\chapter{Methodology}

Based on our related work, describe (using the goals outlined in the beginning) the approach I take:
creating a better model to be used in carbon-aware scheduling 
using the model and evaluating it.
\section{Improving the current Job model} \label{sec:improving_the_model}

We should probably argue why the current job model used in literature is not sufficient (WaitAWhile\cite{wiesner_lets_2021} assumed constant power usage and no overhead from stopping and resuming)

\subsection{Power Measurements on Machine Learning Jobs}
\label{sec:power_measurements}

\todo{Für die Durchführung von Messungen ist es zwingend erforderlich, die verwendete Testumgebung (Hardware wie auch Software) zu dokumentieren sowie Messparameter gewissenhaft zu wählen. Zu den wichtigsten Parametern gehren die Anzahl der Messwiederholungen, die Anwendung von Warmup-Läufen sowie die Identifikation und Vermeidung möglicher störender Einflüsse.}

\todo{I feel like I should add a paragraph somewhere explaining what I want to measure}

\paragraph{Options for measuring power}

There are multiple options for measuring the power of a given computer. One way of classifying these options would be under them being either \emph{logical measurements} or \emph{physical measurements}.

Logical ones would create a model on some metrics and derive the used power. One example would be using Linux' \emph{perf} tool to read hardware performance counters. \todo{This needs some more here}

Advantages of choosing a logical approach would be that no external hardware is needed and that the overhead of the measurement would be low, as the hardware counters are being kept track of anyway. Disadvantages on the other hand would be that such a model would have to be created or chosen and would include some form of error as all models do.

Physical measurements follow another route; measurement devices would be put between the operating hardware and the power supply. The point where a power measuring device is inserted would dictate what could and could not be measured, a wall mounted measurement device could only measure all power going into a computer and not differentiate between individual programs.

Advantages of physical measurements are that they can give a more holistic measurement of a system as would be the case for a wall mounted measurement device. Portability is an issue however, unlike operating-system supported tools such as perf, a measurement device would need more effort to be used on another system (or be entirely not useable, for example when such devices are only rated for a certain power level).

Due to having a power-measurement tool on-site in our university and it allowing whole-system measurements directly, I chose to follow the physical measurement option. 

\paragraph{Measurement tool}

The concrete tool used is the \emph{Microchip MCP39F511N Power Monitor (henceforth called MCP)}, which can be inserted between the device to test and the wall mounted power supply. A picture of it can be found in figure \ref{fig:mcp}. The MCP can report the current power consumption in 10 mW steps, each 5ms.

\begin{figure}
    \missingfigure{A figure of the MCP, ask Sven about this}
    \caption[short]{The MCP}
    \label{fig:mcp}
\end{figure}

\todo{I could include an extra paragraph on why the MCP is cool, and what it does differently, perhaps. Was there anything cool? I vaguely remember some measurement devices having two capacitors to more accurately determine usage}

I then used \emph{pinpoint}, a tool for energy profiling that can use different inputs, among them being the MCP, to read out its data. 

\paragraph{The test environment}

The experiments were run on my personal computer, the components of that are listed via the \emph{hwlist} tool, with unnecessary columns and rows being redacted for brevity:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, frame=single, numbers=none, caption={Hardware that was measured}, basicstyle=\ttfamily]
   $ lshw -short -C processor -C memory -C display -C bus
Class          Description
==========================
bus            AB350 Gaming K4
memory         16GiB System Memory
processor      AMD Ryzen 5 1600X Six-Core Processor
display        GP104 [GeForce GTX 1070]
\end{lstlisting}

Information about the operating system is given via \emph{hostnamectl}, again some parts redacted:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, frame=single, numbers=none, caption={Used operating system information}, basicstyle=\ttfamily]
    $ hostnamectl 
   Operating System: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS                
             Kernel: Linux 6.8.0-39-generic
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Measured Program}

Machine learning (ML) was used as the main motivation for checkpoint \& resume scheduling in the related works\cite {wiesner_lets_2021} and thus was also chosen by me to be measured and modeled. 

The concrete model and framework is secondary for our measurement. In my case, a small model would be chosen in order to have fewer data points for processing as well as faster iterations on the measurement script. 

There is a vast amount of machine learning frameworks. For a high-level model, the feature set of the framework only needed to support checkpointing, resuming, and some basic form of logging. 
Glancing at the documentation of popular frameworks such as \emph{torch}, \emph{tensorflow}, and \emph{huggingface} shows that these features are commonly supported. 

With not much bias towards any framework, huggingface was chosen because my supervisor Felix supplied a sample "hello-world"-esque machine learning script for python \emph{roberta.py}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Quacck/master-thesis/blob/main/power-measurements/roberta.py}}.

The huggingface trainer supports callbacks, I thus modified the code by adding timestamped logs. These "Events" would be output into another .csv File I could later use.\todo{Later use for WHAT?!}

\paragraph{Conducted Experiments}

A script \footnote{\url{https://github.com/Quacck/master-thesis/blob/main/power-measurements/measure_roberta.sh}} was created to execute each experiment. 

On a high-level view, the following experiments were conducted: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \label{experiment:full}Run the whole program start to finish
    \item \label{experiment:partial_checkpointed}Run it partially, checkpointing after some step, sleeping, resuming from that step
    \item \label{experiment:partial_checkpointed_aborted}Run it partially, checkpointing after some step but aborting before the next checkpoint. Then resume as above.
    \item \label{experiment:startup_only}Run only the startup phase up until the ML would start
    \item \label{experiment:baseline}Do nothing, measure the system at rest
\end{enumerate}

Experiment \ref{experiment:full} would give a baseline for what the job would look like without checkpoint \& resume. Number \ref{experiment:partial_checkpointed} and \ref{experiment:partial_checkpointed_aborted} would be used to determine the overhead of checkpointing the job. \ref{experiment:startup_only} would be used to validate the other ones. The last experiment is necessary to determine the baseline energy consumption of the environment.

To execute these experiments inside a repeatable bash script, additional command line parameters were added to the given python script. 
For example, there would be a boolean parameter \verb|--resume_from_checkpoint|, or an integer parameter \verb|--stop_after_epoch| would be used for experiment \ref{experiment:full} to \ref{experiment:partial_checkpointed}. 
The way of doing experiment \ref{experiment:startup_only} was to copy the script, and delete everything after the imports.

\paragraph{Creating repeatable measurements}

As this is being run on standard hardware on a standard operating system, all experiment are subject to noise. 
For example, \emph{Dynamic frequency and voltage scaling (DFVS)}, the OS technique of increasing CPU "speeds" according to work load would add power in an uncontrolled way. Also, background tasks may happen "randomly", increasing power usage. 

Thus, for the testing, any foreground apps would be closed. I also used \emph{cpupower}, as shown in snippet below, to set the CPU frequency to a set value:

\todo{Think about whether this is really interesting, I guess keep it if I need more content}
\todo{What is the MAXFREQ of my ryzen 5?}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, frame=single, numbers=none, caption={Used operating system information}, basicstyle=\ttfamily]
    MINFREQ=$(cpupower frequency-info --hwlimits | sed -n '1d;p' \
        | awk '{print $1}')
    MAXFREQ=$(cpupower frequency-info --hwlimits | sed -n '1d;p' \
        | awk '{print $1}')
    
    cpupower frequency-set --min ${MAXFREQ} &>/dev/null
    cpupower frequency-set --max ${MAXFREQ} &>/dev/null

    # ... conduct experiments

    cpupower frequency-set --min ${MINFREQ} &>/dev/null
    cpupower frequency-set --max ${MAXFREQ} &>/dev/null
\end{lstlisting}
\label{listing:setting_cpu_frequency}

As machine learning makes use of available GPUs, the frequency should also be similarly set to a defined value. 
NVIDIA provides guide on how to do so \footnote{\url{https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/advanced-api-performance-setstablepowerstate}}.
Sadly, my used GPU, the NVIDIA GTX 1070, is not capable of fixing the frequency as of the time of conducting these experiments. 
While it is supposed to be possible according to SOURCE\todo{Reconstruct this argument, perhaps theres still something in my PC history | grep}, but there seems to currently be drivers issue preventing this\todo{Find the forum post of people complaining}. 
Thus, the frequency of the GPU was not fixed. 
To reduce the effect of frequency scaling here, the time between experiments was increased generously so that any impact from such scaling would reoccur throughout each run and there would be reduced dependency between runs.

\todo{further explain how the experiments were conducted}

\paragraph{Conducting each experiment}

Each experiment was re-run 10 times. Between each run, there would be a \verb|sleep| period of 10 seconds and one of two minutes in the partial executions. 
Additionally, \verb|pinpoint|'s feature of measuring before and after the actual program-to-test would be used. 
This leads to a period of 30 seconds being measured around the actual experiment. 
Plotting these additional time frames would give a quick visual indicator whether experiments are sufficiently isolated from each other, ergo when the power draw is at the baseline as the actual program starts.

As there is some data being downloaded and persisted during the execution of the ML, before each run, the data would be cleaned up.

\paragraph{Collected data}

For each experiment, a named and timestamped folder would be created in the \verb|/power-measurements| folder of my repository. Each folder would then hold a \verb|.csv| with pinpoint's timestamped power measurements. 
The added timestamped-logging would be saved into another \verb|.csv|. 
While figuring out how to conduct the experiments, I would then plot these measurements early and visually spot if there were any obvious errors or mistakes.

\paragraph{Determining the baseline power draw}

Beginning with the most exiting experiment, determining the baseline and testing the amount of the underlying environment. 
One sample run is shown in Figure \ref{fig:plot_baseline}.
The blue dots in figure represent each data point. The red line is a smoothed Gaussian trend line with $\sigma = 2$. 
Dark-green vertical lines are the logged or derived "events" for each run. In this case, nothing happens, so it is only the start and end of \verb|sleep 120|. 
Notice how the trace starts 30 seconds before the start and continues for another 30 seconds because of the aforementioned \verb|pinpoint| feature.
Going further, these additional measurements will be redacted for brevity, unless something worth mentioning happens outside the actual experiments.\todo{Check later if something interesting happens or if I should reword this.}

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{power-measurements/measurements_sleep_0714004033/plot.pdf}
    \caption{Sample run of the baseline experiment}
    \label{fig:plot_baseline}
\end{figure}

Across all 10 runs, the average baseline power draw is calculated via the mean of all data points. This comes out as an average of 49.8 W with a standard deviation of 4.4 W.

The baseline power draw will be less interesting going further, but will put perspective on the power draws of the other experiments. The standard deviation should give a broad idea of how much noise is in the system environment.

\paragraph{The non-interrupted run}

For the non-interrupted machine learning run, a figure of a sample run is provided in \ref{fig:plot_full}. 
Figure \ref{fig:plot_full_stacked} shows the stacked trend lines of the 10 different runs.
For simplicity's sake, I refrained from doing more elaborate statistical analysis on the different runs as the visual check of them being very similar seemed enough. 
There was an option to discuss the measurement results after normalizing each measurement point to its phase, but that would not change the result.\todo{What?}

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{power-measurements/measurements_roberta_full_0714010405/plot.pdf}
    \caption{Sample run of the full run experiment}
    \label{fig:plot_full}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{power-measurements/stacked_plots/roberta_full_0714.pdf}
    \caption{Stacked trend lines of the power consumption for the full runs}
    \label{fig:plot_full_stacked}
\end{figure}

The main takeaways from these measurements are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item There is a long (about 25\%) start-up phase, which is spent in starting python, loading libraries, and loading data to disc.
    \item There are periodical work-phases; a high-power training phase would be followed by low-power evaluation\todo{Uhm, where did my evaluation phase markers go?? They are mushed together as they share a label} phase and a low-power checkpointing.
    \item There also appears to be higher variance in measurements during the training phases in comparison to the others.
\end{enumerate}

This already shows, that improvements upon the constant-power model used in \cite{wiesner_lets_2021} are possible. 
For example, in this case the start-up phase has a much lower power-draw than the work-phase.

\paragraph{Results of the checkpoint and restore experiment}

Similarly to before, results will be discussed using the stacked plots \ref{fig:plot_partial_saved_stacked} and \ref{fig:plot_partial_saved_continue_stacked}; each individual run is plotted in the repository, however.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{power-measurements/stacked_plots/roberta_stop_after_saving.pdf}
    \caption{Power draws of the ML up until stopping after epoch 2}
    \label{fig:plot_partial_saved_stacked}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{power-measurements/stacked_plots/roberta_continue_after_saving.pdf}
    \caption{Power draws after continuing from the second checkpoint}
    \label{fig:plot_partial_saved_continue_stacked}
\end{figure}

Here we can observe that

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The amount of work done is the same. 
    Similarly to the full-run experiment, the ML still takes the full 5 epochs and has the same work-phases
    \item There is no overhead from checkpointing itself, as the checkpoints are being created regardless of them being resumed from later.
    \item Resuming the jobs results in an added start-up phase. This phase is slightly shorter by a few seconds than the ones in the full runs, likely due to not needing to download the dataset again.
\end{enumerate}

Additional considerations are that the amount of epoch that are worked off before checkpointing and resuming may matter, but it will be assumed that this is not the case.\todo{I could just run this again with another epoch parameter}

\paragraph{Results from checkpoint and resume with abort}

Unlike the previous experiment, where work is stopped as soon as checkpoint is created, this time the program will be stopped just before a checkpoint is created (in this case just the second checkpoint would be saved). 
This should show the maximum created overhead from a checkpoint \& resume strategy. 

While this may sound artificial, it could happen in environments where the interaction between the scheduler and the job is not well orchestrated, for example in an environment where jobs are stopped "at random" like in a cloud spot instance.\todo{Improve the wording here}.

Again, the results are visualized in figure \ref{fig:plot_partial_abort_stacked} and \ref{fig:plot_partial_abort_continue_stacked}. Attention should be paid to:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The behavior of the repeated start-up phase is kept
    \item There is now a full additional training phase added to the overall work
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{power-measurements/stacked_plots/roberta_stop_without_saving.pdf}
    \caption{Power draws of the ML up until stopping after epoch 2}
    \label{fig:plot_partial_abort_stacked}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{power-measurements/stacked_plots/roberta_continue_after_not_saving.pdf}
    \caption{Power draws after continuing from the second checkpoint}
    \label{fig:plot_partial_abort_continue_stacked}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Calculating the energy costs of each run}

To support the argument that there is indeed an overhead from checkpointing \& resuming, I calculated the energy needed via integral of each experiment:

\begin{itemize}
    \item  unstopped costs 12.97 kJ on average with an std of 0.04
    \item  save+resume costs 13.94 kJ on average with an std of 0.1
    \item  save+abort+resume costs 15.72 kJ on average with an std of 0.07
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Defining a new model}

Now that we know what a high-level job looks like, we can pick it apart and reduce the real-world measurements of one program to a more generic model. 

Summarizing the findings from the previous paragraphs; it was shown that 

\begin{itemize}
    \item The given job has phases that have different power draws
    \item Checkpointing \& resuming carries overhead in the form of startup costs and possible wasted work.
\end{itemize}

The parameters for the improved job model are shown in form of the python implementation in \ref{listing:model_python}. \todo{Check whether this ref works}

\todo{Probably need to improve the code here}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python, frame=single, numbers=none, caption={Python Model definition}, basicstyle=\ttfamily, label={listing:model_python}]
class ModelParameters(TypedDict):
    startup: List[Phase]
    work: List[Phase]
    
class Phase(TypedDict):
    name: str
    duration: float
    power: float
    is_checkpoint: NotRequired[bool]   
\end{lstlisting}

Some simplifications are made: the duration of each phase is well known and the power per phase is a constant. Phases can also be named for later reference.
Using these specifications, a simple time-to-power function can be defined, that looks up the input time and traverses the phases in order. While not very efficient, this works well enough in a simulation environment.

The measurements that have been taken can now be fit into this new model. 
As each measurement-point can be associated to a phase via the aforementioned added logging, the average of each phase-associated measurement is used to determine the model parameters. 
The durations of the phases are calculated simularly by taking the average time the logging occured during the measurements.

Using this strategy on the 10 complete runs results in figure \ref{fig:model_overlaid}, which shows the derived model on black with the previous figure \ref{fig:plot_full} in less opacity. 
The startup phase looks well approximated, visually however there is some error during the work phases.
The training phases each have a high variance, which is not captured by the constant power approximation. After each training  phase, the power goes down seemingly liniarly, which is also approxiimated by the constant.

One notable point, this model is a superset of the previous constant-no-overhead model used in the related work.
These jobs can be modeled with just one workphase, resulting in a constant power over its execution. Leaving the startup phases empty creates no overhead on resuming.

\todo{Should probably add the phase markers back in}
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{power-measurements/model_overlaid.pdf}
    \caption{Model of roberta.py (black) vs. all measurements}
    \label{fig:model_overlaid}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Model error analysis}

To analyse the error of this model, I cross validated the power's and total energy's RMSE using \verb|scikit-learn|'s \verb|LeaveOneOut| strategy. 
The first one would give a measure of the model's accuracy on a short-time (sub-second) scale, the latter would  tell the long-time (whole job) scale accuracy of the model.

Each of the 10 runs would be taken as the ground truth while the other 9 would be used to create the model. The results are the following: t power between the prediction and remainder has an RSME of 39.3 W while the difference in total energy is calculated as -0.1 kJ. 

Interpreting this, it seems that the model performs poorly as a predictor for die exact power used at some timepoint as the RMSE is rather large (think of the maximum power drawn being about 250W). 
However, in the context of carbon aware scheduling, this should not be too big of an issue as the time frames for carbon-emissions are order of magnitude larger. 
The high error likely comes from the high variance during the training phases which is not captured in the model.

The total energy predicted by the model is very close to the actual real life experiment, this should mean that the total carbon calculated on the model should also be close to the carbon emitted by the real program.

\section{Choosing an implementation approach}

Now that an improvement on the job model has been made, the question, on how to evaluate the implications of said model, remains. 

% We first need to explain why we chose our approach (building upon exisiting work inside GAIA). The other option that is not using a simulation would be to schedule real jobs, for example by creating a slurm plugin.

% We can then evaluate how well a slurm plugin would work for our given Forschungsragen. End that section by deeming the plugin idea as unfit, we can then shift to arguing for the simulation approach as that is also something that just came out in related work (perhaps we should see wether we list GAIA as related work or introduce it just then)

\subsection{Carbon-aware scheduling via a slurm plugin}
\label{subsec:slurm_plugin}

My first idea was to use a non-simulation approach. 
The HPI's Data Lab \footnote{\url{https://hpi.de/forschung/infrastruktur/hpi-data-engineering-lab.html}} runs a \emph{slurm} cluster and also has some nodes with power measurement infrastucture included. 
Slurm is an "open source, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job scheduling system for large and small Linux clusters"\footnote{\url{https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html}}. 
The job scheduling part is important here, it also supports a plugin infrastructure that includes scheduling plugins. 
One of the highlighted papers\cite{inigo_goiri_greenslot_2011} in the related works section specifically used slurm for its carbon-aware scheduler implementation and thus seemed like a good starting point for my own work.

\paragraph{Installing Slurm locally}

For my purposes, a local installation would suffice as I would not need to run heavy workloads but instead just the scheduling part of slurm. 
While there is a slurm \verb|apt get| package for my ubuntu version, this would not work as any plugins to be included during the slurm compilation, meaning I would have to do the same.

Slurm's documentation provides some guidelines on how to install slurm, which I followed. 
I gave cloning the main branch an attempt but I would get stuck during the compilation process, using the predefined released versions however worked.

Installing \verb|munge|\footnote{\url{https://github.com/dun/munge/wiki/Installation-Guide}} is also necessary, which is used for authentication in slurm.

One problem arose as I tried to start the \verb|slurmd|- and \verb|slurmctld| services. The first one is the worker service that would later execute jobs submitted to slurm. The latter is the main controller that, for example, schedules jobs on workers. While the command to start them would not fail, upon node inspection via Slurm's \verb|scontrol| command, it would show that all nodes are \verb|DOWN| instantly.
|
Dealing with slurm's problems usually leads to inspecting its logs, in my case the logs showed the following:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, frame=single, numbers=none, caption={Slurm error logs}, basicstyle=\ttfamily]
$ less config.log

error: Couldn't find the specified plugin name for cgroup/v2
    looking at all files
error: cannot find cgroup plugin for cgroup/v2
error: cannot create cgroup context for cgroup/v2
error: Unable to initialize cgroup plugin
error: slurmd initialization failed

\end{lstlisting}

Slurm uses Linux' \verb|cgroup| feature to manage the submitted job's hardware ressources. The log hints at some problem related to slurm's usage of it.
The solution was this was to provide slurm's \verb|cgroup.conf| file. In my use-case of getting slurm to simply start, this did not need to be very sophisticated so I just used an off-the-shelf (off-the-stackoverflow\footnote{\url{https://stackoverflow.com/a/74211989}}) configuration file.

Running \verb|scontrol| again, I was finally able to see idling nodes, meaning that slurm was succesfully installed form source:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, frame=single, numbers=none, caption={Slurm running}, basicstyle=\ttfamily]
$ scontrol
scontrol: update NodeName=vincent-Laptop STATE=RESUME
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Creating a scheduler plugin}

The slurm documentation provides a short guide on how to add a plugin to slurm.\footnote{\url{https://slurm.schedmd.com/add.html}}. 
As a start, I simply copied slurm's default scheduler (which is also a plugin) to to the specified directory under a new name, and addings that new name to slurms build files. 
It was then was time to recompile slurm. 
Now however, during the recommended \verb|autoreconf| step, an error occured:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, frame=single, numbers=none, caption={Plugin recompilation errors}, basicstyle=\ttfamily]
$ autoreconf
auxdir/x_ac_sview.m4:35: warning: macro 'AM_PATH_GLIB_2_0' 
    not found in library
configure:25140: error: possibly undefined macro: AM_PATH_GLIB_2_0
      If this token and others are legitimate, 
      please use m4_pattern_allow.
      See the Autoconf documentation.
autoreconf: error: /usr/bin/autoconf failed with exit status: 1
\end{lstlisting}

The solution, while not very obvious, was to install the \verb|libgtk2.0-dev| library. \footnote{\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7805815/autoconf-error-on-ubuntu-11-04}}. 
I then added a simple logging which then showed up in slurm's log files too.

\paragraph{Adding more logic to the scheduler plugin}

One very helpful step for developing inside slurm is to enable the debugging flags.
This must be decided before compilation by using the \verb|--enable-developer| and \verb|--disable-optimizations| flags during the \verb|/configure| step. 
With that, debug symbols are added to the outgoing binaries. 
As I was using vscode, I could then attach its debugger to the running slurm thread with full functionality.

The code of the plugin runs in its own thread and there is no sandboxing or similar around it.
Thus there are seemingly no limitation on what can be done inside the plugin. 
For testing, I read out information on the incoming jobs such as set constraints or the user supplied comments. Terminating the jobs was also possible inside the plugin.

\paragraph{Problems of a scheduler plugin}

One big problem manifested in that not all jobs "showed up" inside the plugin's job queue. 
If I would submit 6 jobs, via slurm's \verb|squeue| command, only a part such as the last 3 could be logged inside the plugin.
A possible explaination for this could be slurms scheduler architecture: while there is a scheduler plugin, there also is a scheduler inside slurm's main loop. 
That main scheduler loop also uses the same job queue as the plugin.

To hack around this, I tried disabling slurm's main scheduling loop by setting \verb|sched_interval=-1| inside the slurm configuration file. 
While this had the effect of being able to access all incoming jobs inside the plugin, it also had the side-effect of disabling all logic concerning starting the jobs.
So by choosing this route, the plugin would apparently also need to re-implement alot of extra logic, which conventionally would be not be put inside the scheduler plugin. 

I also looked into whether there were any API hooks that are exposed to the plugin. 
Up until slurm version 20.11, scheduler plugins had callbacks such as when jobs were submitted. There also was support for "passive" scheduler that would get invoked when determined by slurm.
The version I tested however,  23.11, removed all such functionality and documentation. All plugins are implemented via threads that only have callbacks on when they are started and stopped.

Thus, since there was no apparent way of getting around this scheduler race condition between the plugin and the main loop. 
The scheduler approach as a whole was dropped. 
While I would not say that a plugin approach is impossible, the effort to implement one from scratch subjectivly seems very high. 
The public documentation for developing on slurm is scarce. 
There is a mailing list that can be searched, but it looks to be mostly aimed for administrating slurm and not developing it.

Other avenues that could be explored are slurm's Lua plugins. There is also a \emph{slurm simulator}\footnote{\url{https://hpckp.org/articles/how-to-use-the-slurm-simulator-as-a-development-and-testing-environment/}} which could potentially be used for carbon-aware scheduling simulation, but that I did not look into much for reasons of little documentation and seeming lack of continued support.

\subsection{Using a Simulation approach}

Thankfully, just at that time, a new paper \cite{hanafy_going_2024} was released. 
They made a prototype testbed for simulating job scheduling on cloud providers. These Jobs could be executed on spot instances (cheap VMs that seek to increase cloud utilization), on-demand instances (short-notices VMs that are thus more expensive) or pre bought VMs (medium cost, but may be wasted), the paper then discussed balancing carbon- and dollar costs. 
They included a small notion notion of hardwre requirements in the form of required CPUs per job, but that was only used to scale the cost; all hardware requirements were abstracted away in the form of the cloud always having computing ressources available.

The important part is that they also included an implementation of some schedulers used in the highlighted related works. Among that an implementation for WaitAWhile\cite{wiesner_lets_2021}.
This meant that I could add the improved job model to that exisiting testbed and have something to compare against aswell.

\paragraph{Description of the GAIA simulator}

I would first like to describe the existing testbed in detail to make it clear which part is my work and which is not. A class diagram is provided in \ref{fig:class_diagram} which is heavily inspired by the existing architecture diagram in the original paper.

\end{figure}

The main part of GAIA is the scheduler. At program start, it takes parameters\todo{I should probably give an overview of which parameters are supported so I have that terminology later} that determine the scheduling, such as wheter tasks can be interrupted, how to use the carbon information (e.g. use a perfect-information / oracle approach or to use a running average), and how to balance the dollar cost for scheduling. 
The latter I removed for simplicity, which is marked in the figure via the red color of the reserved and spot instances. In my case of carbon-aware scheduling, I did not need that feature.

In the original implementation, the scheduler had multiple queues of tasks. 
The paper presented an approach of a short queue (tasks under 2 hours) and long tasks (all other), short tasks would get scheduled on spot instances. 
Again, as I already removed the spot instance, feature, I did not need to multiplicity of queues and they were thus removed. 

The tasks queues are are based on historical traces. GAIA provided muliple traces already that are described in the paper. To those I added a trace of of the HPI's Data Lab, which will be analysed in section \todo{Link this}.

Tasks have a predetermined length (as saved in the trace), and they also hold some data that is used for scheduling such as their arrival time in the system, and how long they should wait until execution. 
Some properties such as required CPUs were removed.
My contribtion of the phases-and-power model was added to the tasks.

The Scheduler policies are also marked green, as I added scheduler policies that could use this new model. Specifically, I added a (non-) checkpoint \& resume scheduler that works on oracle carbon prediction, this will be further explained in the latter sections.

Scheduled Tasks are submitted to a cluster.
In my case, this is a simulated, already implemented, cluster that simply logs when each tasks is entered and when they are finished. 
In the original paper, they also used an open source adapter that would submit the tasks to an actual Slurm cluster. 
While this approach could have been used, I decided against it on the basis of not adding further complexity. 
Thus I also removed the slurm adapter from my implementation.

\section{Implementing simulation-schedulers using the new model}

I would first like to summarize assumption that GAIA makes on the problem of carbon aware scheduling:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item job lengths are known
    \item all considered jobs are batch jobs and can thus be shifted temporally based on user deadlines
    \item carbon information is provided for near future time spans, no error is considered
    \item there are no hardware limitations or considerations, all jobs are executed in an isolated manner
    \item jobs have a constant power draw and can be checkpointed \& resumed for free
\end{enumerate}

Especially the last point will be modified going further. As shown in section \ref{sec:improving_the_model}, jobs now have a predefined, variable power draw according to the defined phases. Resuming a job also carries an additional startup phase with it.

\subsection{Modifying the existing jobs to use the new model}

The first step to be taken was to add the described model to the jobs as outlined in figure \ref{fig:class_diagram}. 
So far, jobs were generated from \verb|csv|-formatted traces, one example being provided in listing \ref{list:trace_csv}.

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, numbers=none, caption={Excerpt from the Alibaba-PAI trace}, label={list:trace_csv}, basicstyle=\ttfamily]
arrival_time,   length,     cpus
0.0,            6302.0,     1
68.0,           1000.0,     1
463.0,          1570.0,     3
838.0,          23549.0,    1
\end{lstlisting}

In the original GAIA implementation, jobs have an \verb|arrival_time|, which signify when the job should be added to the simulation in seconds. 
The \verb|length| of a job similarly encodes the seconds a job needs to fully execute. The \verb|cpu| column was not interesting for my work, as previously discussed.

The chosen way of supplying the model information was to add two new columns to the trace files, which would entail the type of job and a column for arguments. 
As of now, the following types are supported: \verb|constant|, \verb|mocked-constant-from-phases|, \verb|phases|, and \verb|ml|. 
The first two \verb|constant| types are for backward-compatibility with GAIA, and would be used in the evaluation later. 

Type \verb|phases| is the main way of creating a job with phases such as the one used in the experiment. The supplied argument in that case would entail a python readable \verb|dict|, essentially a \verb|JSON|-like definition of the model as described in listing \ref{listing:model_python}.
As this was just a string, I would then use Python's \verb|eval()| to read it back into a python object.\todo{Check how and if I should visualize this}
As an example, a simplified \verb|roberta.py|, the job that was measured in section \ref{sec:power_measurements}, could look like the code in listing \ref{list:roberta_model_definition}

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, numbers=none, caption={Simplified definition for a job similar to the experiment}, label={list:roberta_model_definition}, basicstyle=\ttfamily]
{
    'startup': [
        {'name': 'Start', 'duration': 5.34, 'power': 59.9},
        {'name': 'Finish Imports', 'duration': 12.36, 'power': 53.77},
        {'name': 'Data loaded', 'duration': 5.75, 'power': 63.17}, 
    ],
    'work': [
        {'name': 'Train', 'duration': 8.17, 'power': 221.93}, 
        {'name': 'Evaluate', 'duration': 1.54, 'power': 134.0}, 
        {'name': 'Save', 'duration': 2.72, 'power': 105.1,
            'is_checkpoint': True}, 
    ] * 5
}
\end{lstlisting}

In order to use this model definition and read out the power of a job at a given time, a function was crated that essentially traverses all phases in order, keeping track of the time, and returning the power of the phase when the requested time is reached. 
This was als used to create figure \ref{fig:model_overlaid}.

A generalising helper type is \verb|ml|, which takes a dictionary of paramerters and converts that to model paramerters for the \verb|phases| type. A similar job as to the one above would be created with the following:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, numbers=none, caption={Generic model definition for machine learning jobs}, label={list:roberta_model_definition_generic}, basicstyle=\ttfamily]
{
    'start_duration': 23.45
    'start_power': 60
    'training_duration': 8.17
    'training_power': 221.93
    'evaluate_duration': 1.54
    'evaluate_power': 63.17
    'save_duration': 2.72
    'save_power': 105.1
    'epochs': 5
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Uninterrupted oracle scheduling}

There aleady was an existing version of this scheduling approach which assumed constant power and that the carbon trace would be fully known ("oracle"). 
Jobs would not be able to checkpoint \& resume in this version.
The algorithm for which is pseudocoded in listing \ref{list:pseudocode_oracle}.

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, numbers=left, caption={Pseudocode for non-interrupt oracle scheduling}, label={list:pseudocode_oracle}, basicstyle=\ttfamily]
function schedule_job_no_checkpointing_resuming(job):
    possible_starts = []
    for every possible starttime until deadline:
        calculate carbon_emissions_of_job at starttime
        add carbon_emission to possible_starts
    
    return starttime with least carbon emissions

function carbon_emissions_of_job(job, carbon_trace):
    sum_of_emissions = 0

    for each second of job:
        sum_of_emissions += carbon_trace at timepoint * constant_watt
    
    return sum_of_emissions
\end{lstlisting}

In order to adjust this to the new model where power is a function of time, only line 13 needed to be changed. 
Thus, I implemented a python function whose input are the model parameters (see listing \ref{roberta_model_definition}), and which would return the power at a specified time. 
Evaluating this scheduling approach will take place in section \ref{sec:evaluate_scheduling}, after another scheduling algorithm is introduced.


\subsection{{Checkpoint \& resume scheduling for heterogeneous jobs}}

Under the constant-power, no startup-overhead assumption of the already exisiting implementation, the algorithm for this scheduler worked like the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item order all timeslots until the job deadline by their emissions ascending
    \item exeute the job on those timeslots until done
\end{itemize}

This would minimize the carbon emissions, as only the best timeslots would be used, but would also create unrealistic schedules sometimes. 
For example, in figure \ref{fig:schedule_problems}, if a job's deadline is in the distant future, due to the diurnal nature of the electic grid, the job would be scheduled on the "peaks" of each day. Sometimes this would lead to a job being simulated as being executed for very short timeframs at a time\todo{Check wording}. As shown in the power measurement chapers, this kind of scheduling would create alot of overhead from starting so many times.

\begin{figure}
    \missingfigure{I should show a Gantt chart of the mishappen scheduling for the checkpoint resume scheduler}
    \caption{Problems in the checkpoint \& resume scheduling under the previous assumptions}
    \label{fig:schedule_problems}
\end{figure}


In order to implement a scheduler for the improved job model, I chose to use \emph{linear programming} (also: LP).
In a nutshell, LP is an optimization method, that given linear equations and constraints, finds a set of variables (or a vector) that would minimize (or maximize) an optimization goal. 
The reason for choosing this approach over, for example coming up with a "standard" algorithm, was that I had never used LP before and that due to the "inherent optimization", the burden of\todo{Kann man das so sagen?} proof for the correctness would be lower. LP

Translating this to the context of carbon-aware scheduling, the resulting vector would decode when a job should be executed, the optimization goal would be to minimize the emitted carbon. 
A constraint for example could be that all timeslots being executed should add up to the job length. 
The big challenge is then to model all of this in the form of mathematical equations, which will be most part of this section's remainder.

\paragraph{Personal experience with linear programming}

Linear programming is its own programming paradigm. Unlike, for example, imperative programming, where each instruction would be coded explicitly, enabling classic debugging and such, in LP, a mathematical model would be written which is then solved by a \emph{solver}. 
Different implementations for these solvers exist, but atleast in my case, the result output by a solver would either be an error, or the result set. 
As the solver uses the whole model simultaneously, debugging individual parts of the model is not possible outside of removing them from the overall model.

Thus, an iterative approach to LP proved useful. 
I would encode some part of my overall problem into the model, solve it, and immediatly plot the variables of the result set and check them visually.
The visual check is very important. 
Many times the solver would solve the problem "so well" that jobs would get scheduled in a way that the emitted carbon is minimized, but the jobs would be executed in edge cases that I did not intend but that are possible under the model, examples of this will be given in the following parts.

Another part of programming LP is "just knowing the tricks". 
Many common programming operations, especially ones for control flow, cannot be expressed directly (as they need to be a linear equation).
There are some mapping for such operations, but finding out how seems to be harder than in other paradigms, since the LP community appears to be smaller in comparison and online ressources are limited.
Some "tricks" will be highlighted in the latter parts aswell. 

\paragraph{Modelling carbon-aware scheduling in a linear program}

In this part, I would like to preset the steps taken to model the scheduler as an LP problem, highlight some implementation details and visualizing the results of each step.
I used python's \verb|PuLP| library.
It allows creating LP models to standard file types and also helps in calling external solvers aswell as querying the results.

\subparagraph{Executing the job}

Firstly, as the job has a certain length and a set deadline, I chose to use an array of timeslot-variables as my result set. Each such variable would be a boolean signifiying whether the job would be executed at that time.
For the first constraint, the sum of all boolean variables (which are represented as 0 and 1) should add up to the job length, effectivly executing the job for length-many timeslots.
The necessary objective function is to be defined as each timeslot-being-executed multiplied by the carbon-per-watt at that timeslot.

As an example, the code for this is shown in listing \ref{}
