\chapter{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

For this, we will discuss each contribution, and draw a conclusion in the end.

\section{\modelname{}}

With \modelname{}, we propose a high-level time-to-power model of workloads.
Power heterogeneity is not new, there is prior work that uses this in other contexts.
A drawback of \modelname{} is that it does not capture overhead for suspending a job. 
For example, during the power measurements, power intake would remain high for a few seconds despite the program itself being stopped.
The reason for this were the power settings on my GPU keeping a high profile.
