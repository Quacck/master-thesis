\chapter{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Expand the implementation to only support checkpointing at some points in time, right now work can be suspended anytime
    \item The runtimes for the LP implementation are very bad, there may be other algorithms or further improvements
    \item The testbed should also output the phases, right now these are "hidden" in the scheduler and not really exposed to the outside. Perhaps enabling better debugging support
    \item further research into real-world workloads and their heterogeneity should be done. Using those as a ground-truth for modelling phases -> are there jobs that can better take advantage? Non-perdiodic phases could perhaps better take advantage of the carbon curve
    \item As the scheduling of the suspend resume approach takes very long, a time-efficiency study could be conducted. Especially for the 4 day-deadline jobs, the gab value would be above 95\% indicating a suboptimal solution \@ 20 minutes.
    \item Given that the scheduler is executed on beefy hardware, where is the breakeven point in carbon savings?
\end{itemize}
