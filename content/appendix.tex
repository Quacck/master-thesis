\section{Results of the Structured Literature Review} \label{appendix:literature_review_results}

A \verb|.csv| file of all reviewed papers can be found in the \verb|/literature_study/| folder in the main repository.
We provide an excerpt on the following page.
The whole file also includes notes that were removed for brevity.

% my god, there is nothing I want to do more rn than spend my time on importing a .csv as a table.
% ... I gave up and just used tablesgenerator.com
