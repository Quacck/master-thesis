    \item why is carbon aware scheduling useful? we want to emit less carbon per unit of work, reason being climate change
    \item welche contribution mache ich konkret?
    \item which hypothesis do I have?
    \item for example, we could think that having more information about how our workload's power changes over time, could lead to higher carbon efficiency, as we could for example match high-power to low-carbon periods.
