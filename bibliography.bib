	abstract = {Data Center Networks (DCNs) are attracting growing interest from both academia and industry to keep pace with the exponential growth in cloud computing and enterprise networks. Modern DCNs are facing two main challenges of scalability and cost-effectiveness. The architecture of a DCN directly impacts on its scalability, while its cost is largely driven by its power consumption. In this paper, we conduct a detailed survey of the most recent advances and research activities in DCNs, with a special focus on the architectural evolution of DCNs and their energy efficiency. The paper provides a qualitative categorization of existing DCN architectures into switch-centric and server-centric topologies as well as their design technologies. Energy efficiency in data centers is discussed in details with survey of existing techniques in energy savings, green data centers and renewable energy approaches. Finally, we outline potential future research directions in DCNs.},

	abstract = {In general, a proper balance of temperature and humidity control is essential for efficient datacenter operation and is integral to protecting the significant investment in computer and network technology in datacenter facilities. However, the rising costs of energy and the drive to be green are resulting in a greater demand to conserve energy. One method of reducing facility costs for a chilled water plant is by adding an economizer. The purpose of this study is to develop energy models of the most common economizer systems. A normal chiller plant with an air-side economizer and a water-side economizer are compared. Results show that outdoor conditions influence facility energy consumption. This paper provides terminology and definitions for the two different types of economizer modes and compares their energy performance against key datacenter attributes in temperate or subtropical regions. The electrical end use breakdown and the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) value for a typical year were estimated. The water-side economizer made it possible to achieve a maximum energy performance improvement of about 16.6\% over the reference base cooling system, whereas the air-side economizer made it possible to achieve about 42.4\% improvement.},

Numerous techniques have been proposed to solve the energy efficiency issue in cloud systems. Recently, there are some efforts to decentralize the cloud via distributing data centers in diverse geographical positions. In this paper, we elaborate on the energy consumption of different cloud architectures, from a mega-datacenter to a P2P-cloud that provides extreme decentralization in terms of datacenter size. P2P-cloud is defined as a set of commodity host machines, connected to each other to serve a community. Our evaluation results reveal the fact that the more decentralized the system is, the less energy may be consumed in the system. Studying the energy efficiency of P2P-cloud infrastructure shows that the additional system design complexity involved is warranted with improved energy-efficiency and better locality for some services. Our analysis indicates that such P2P-cloud outperforms the classic datacenter model as long as it meets the locality conditions, which are commonplace in communities. Moreover, we illustrate how much energy can be saved for MapReduce applications with a diverse range of specifications by switching to P2P-cloud.},

	abstract = {Computing researchers have long focused on improving energy-efficiency under the implicit assumption that all energy is created equal. Yet, this assumption is actually incorrect: energy's cost and carbon footprint vary substantially over time. As a result, consuming energy inefficiently when it is cheap and clean may sometimes be preferable to consuming it efficiently when it is expensive and dirty. Green datacenters adapt their energy usage to optimize for such variations, as reflected in changing electricity prices or renewable energy output. Thus, we introduce energy-agility as a new metric to evaluate green datacenter applications. To illustrate fundamental tradeoffs in energy-agile design, we develop GreenSort, a distributed sorting system optimized for energy-agility. GreenSort is representative of the long-running, massively-parallel, data-intensive tasks that are common in datacenters and amenable to delays from power variations. Our results demonstrate the importance of energy-agile design when considering the benefits of using variable power. For example, we show that GreenSort requires 31\% more time and energy to complete when power varies based on real-time electricity prices versus when it is constant. Thus, in this case, real-time prices should be at least 31\% lower than fixed prices to warrant using them.},

There are methodologies to measure this efficiency, one example is using the PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) index. In this paper is proposed a new index for measuring efficiency at the design stage, the EUED (Energy Usage Effectiveness Design). This index allows to evaluate systems using “free cooling” and adiabatic system. A comparison is performed considering the equipment in the worst situation. The thermodynamics parameter enthalpy is used to calculate the results. This new methodology allows to determine differences between the cities of São Paulo and Curitiba (1.21\%) and between Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba (10.61\%). The values for the EUED index were 1.245 kW/kW for Curitiba, 1.260 kW/kW for São Paulo and 1.377 kW/kW for Rio de Janeiro, respectively, reaching a difference of 16.86\% for Curitiba, 16.19\% for São Paulo and 10.31\% for Rio de Janeiro in relation to PUE COA (Power Usage Effectiveness Constant Outdoor Air). The advantage of the EUED is that it works with the 8,760 hours in the design phase, using psychometric elements to determine when to use free cooling and evaporative system, and more importantly varying the COP according to environmental characteristics.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneous architectures offer divers computing capabilities. Composite Cores Architecture (CCA) is a class of dynamic heterogeneous architectures that empowers the system to build the most appropriate core at run-time for each application by composing cores together to make larger core or decomposing a large core into multiple smaller cores. While CCA provides more flexibility for the running application to find the best run-time configurations to maximize energy-efficiency, due to the interdependence of various tuning parameters such as the core type, run-time voltage and frequency setting, and number of threads, it makes the scheduling more challenging. In this work, we investigate the scheduling challenges of multithreaded applications on CCA architectures. This paper describes a systematic approach to predict the right configurations for running multithreaded workloads on the composite cores architecture. It achieves this by developing a machine learning-based approach to predict core type, voltage and frequency to maximize the energy-efficiency. Our predictor learns offline from an extensive set of training multithreaded workloads. It is then applied to predict the optimal processor configuration at run-time by considering of the multithreaded application's characteristics and the optimization objective. For this purpose, five well-known machine learning models are implemented for energy-efficiency optimization and precisely compared in terms of accuracy and hardware overhead to guide the scheduling decisions in a CCA. The results show that while complex machine learning models such as MultiLayerPerceptron are achieving higher accuracy, after evaluating their implementation overheads, they perform worst in terms of power, accuracy/area and latency as compared to simpler but slightly less accurate regression-based and tree-based classifiers.},

This problem represents an extension of the classical job-shop scheduling problem, where each operation has to be executed by one machine and this machine can work at different speeds.

Energy-efficiency scheduling, as a novel energy-efficient method, has attracted the attention of an increasing number of researchers in recent years. Drying process is the most energy-intensive production process in tissue paper mills, which has a great energy-saving potential. This paper aims to reduce the energy costs for the tissue paper mill, consisting of processing energy cost and set-up energy cost, through integrating drying process optimization with energy-efficient scheduling. First, the energy cost model and the scheduling model were built. Then, the energy cost of the drying process of every job in a given scheduling problem was optimized using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Afterwards, the energy cost was further optimized using energy-efficiency scheduling. In addition, a hybrid non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) was utilized to solve the energy-efficiency scheduling problem. Finally, several real scheduling problems from a real tissue paper mill were addressed using the proposed approach to demonstrate its effectiveness in energy saving. The experiment result showed that there is a great energy-saving potential in the drying process, accounting for up to 12.53\% of the total energy consumption. Moreover, the maximum energy saving ratio of the proposed approach could reach 9.03\%. On the whole, the proposed approach can provide a new energy-saving method for tissue paper mills or other manufacturing industries.},

The characteristics of individual applications, the assignment of applications to machines and execution contexts, and the selection of processor frequencies have a dramatic impact on resource contention, performance, and energy efficiency. We employ the concept of task activity vectors for caracterizing applications by resource utilization. Based on this characterization, we apply migration and co-scheduling policies that improve performance and energy efficiency by combining applications that use complementary resources, and use frequency scaling when scheduling cannot avoid contention owing to inauspicious workloads. We integrate the policies into an operating system scheduler and into a virtualization system, allowing placement decisions to be made both within and across physical nodes, and reducing contention both for individual tasks and complete applications. Our evaluation based on the Linux operating system kernel and the KVM virtualization environment shows that resource-conscious scheduling reduces the energy delay product considerably.},

	abstract = {Although users of high-performance computing are most interested in raw performance, both energy and power consumption have become critical concerns. One approach to lowering energy and power is to use high-performance cluster nodes that have several power-performance states so that the energy-time trade-off can be dynamically adjusted. This paper analyzes the energy-time trade-off of a wide range of applications—serial and parallel—on a power-scalable cluster. We use a cluster of frequency and voltage-scalable AMD-64 nodes, each equipped with a power meter. We study the effects of memory and communication bottlenecks via direct measurement of time and energy. We also investigate metrics that can, at runtime, predict when each type of bottleneck occurs. Our results show that, for programs that have a memory or communication bottleneck, a power-scalable cluster can save significant energy with only a small time penalty. Furthermore, we find that, for some programs, it is possible to both consume less energy and execute in less time by increasing the number of nodes while reducing the frequency-voltage setting of each node.},

	abstract = {With the latest high-end computing nodes combining shared-memory multiprocessing with hardware multithreading, new scheduling policies are necessary for workloads consisting of multithreaded applications. The use of hybrid multiprocessors presents schedulers with the problem of job pairing, i.e. deciding which specific jobs can share each processor with minimum performance penalty, by running on different execution contexts. Therefore, scheduling policies are expected to decide not only which job mix will execute simultaneously across the processors, but also which jobs can be combined within each processor. This paper addresses the problem by introducing new scheduling policies that use run-time performance information to identify the best mix of threads to run across processors and within each processor. Scheduling of threads across processors is driven by the memory bandwidth utilization of the threads, whereas scheduling of threads within processors is driven by one of three metrics: bus transaction rate per thread, stall cycle rate per thread, or outermost level cache miss rate per thread. We have implemented and experimentally evaluated these policies on a real multiprocessor server with Intel Hyperthreaded processors. The policy using bus transaction rate for thread pairing achieves an average 13.4\% and a maximum 28.7\% performance improvement over the Linux scheduler. The policy using stall cycle rate for thread pairing achieves an average 9.5\% and a maximum 18.8\% performance improvement. The average and maximum performance gains of the policy using cache miss rate for thread pairing are 7.2\% and 23.6\% respectively.},

Scheduling has a dramatic impact on the delay introduced by memory contention, but also on the effectiveness of frequency scaling at saving energy. This paper investigates the cross-effects between tasks running on a multicore system, considering memory contention and the technical constraint of chip-wide frequency and voltage settings. We make the following contributions: 1) We identify the memory characteristics of tasks and sort core-specific runqueues to allow a co-scheduling of tasks with minimal energy delay product. 2) According to the memory characteristics of the workload, we set the frequency for individual chips so that the delay is only marginal. Our evaluation with a Linux implementation running on an Intel quad-core shows that memory-aware scheduling can reduce EDP considerably.},

	abstract = {With the surging energy price and environmental concerns, measures to improve energy efficiency have attracted increasing concerns of the manufacture sector, especially energy-intensive manufacturing industries such as tissue paper mills. Energy-efficiency scheduling, as a novel energy-efficient method, has attracted the attention of an increasing number of researchers in recent years. Drying process is the most energy-intensive production process in tissue paper mills, which has a great energy-saving potential. This paper aims to reduce the energy costs for the tissue paper mill, consisting of processing energy cost and set-up energy cost, through integrating drying process optimization with energy-efficient scheduling. First, the energy cost model and the scheduling model were built. Then, the energy cost of the drying process of every job in a given scheduling problem was optimized using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Afterwards, the energy cost was further optimized using energy-efficiency scheduling. In addition, a hybrid non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) was utilized to solve the energy-efficiency scheduling problem. Finally, several real scheduling problems from a real tissue paper mill were addressed using the proposed approach to demonstrate its effectiveness in energy saving. The experiment result showed that there is a great energy-saving potential in the drying process, accounting for up to 12.53\% of the total energy consumption. Moreover, the maximum energy saving ratio of the proposed approach could reach 9.03\%. On the whole, the proposed approach can provide a new energy-saving method for tissue paper mills or other manufacturing industries.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneous multicore systems—comprised of multiple cores with varying capabilities, performance, and energy characteristics—have emerged as a promising approach to increasing energy efﬁciency. Such systems reduce energy consumption by identifying phase changes in an application and migrating execution to the most efﬁcient core that meets its current performance requirements. However, due to the overhead of switching between cores, migration opportunities are limited to coarse-grained phases (hundreds of millions of instructions), reducing the potential to exploit energy efﬁcient cores. We propose Composite Cores, an architecture that reduces switching overheads by bringing the notion of heterogeneity within a single core. The proposed architecture pairs big and little compute µEngines that together can achieve high performance and energy efﬁciency. By sharing much of the architectural state between the µEngines, the switching overhead can be reduced to near zero, enabling ﬁne-grained switching and increasing the opportunities to utilize the little µEngine without sacriﬁcing performance. An intelligent controller switches between the µEngines to maximize energy efﬁciency while constraining performance loss to a conﬁgurable bound. We evaluate Composite Cores using cycle accurate microarchitectural simulations and a detailed power model. Results show that, on average, the controller is able to map 25\% of the execution to the little µEngine, achieving an 18\% energy savings while limiting performance loss to 5\%.},

At the microarchitectural level, McPAT includes models for the fundamental components of a chip multiprocessor, including in-order and out-of-order processor cores, networks-on-chip, shared caches, integrated memory controllers, and multiple-domain clocking. At the circuit and technology levels, McPAT supports critical-path timing modeling, area modeling, and dynamic, short-circuit, and leakage power modeling for each of the device types forecast in the ITRS roadmap including bulk CMOS, SOI, and doublegate transistors. McPAT has a flexible XML interface to facilitate its use with many performance simulators. Combined with a performance simulator, McPAT enables architects to consistently quantify the cost of new ideas and assess tradeoffs of different architectures using new metrics like energy-delay-area2 product (EDA2P) and energy-delay-area product (EDAP). This paper explores the interconnect options of future manycore processors by varying the degree of clustering over generations of process technologies. Clustering will bring interesting tradeoffs between area and performance because the interconnects needed to group cores into clusters incur area overhead, but many applications can make good use of them due to synergies of cache sharing. Combining power, area, and timing results of McPAT with performance simulation of PARSEC benchmarks at the 22nm technology node for both common in-order and out-of-order manycore designs shows that when die cost is not taken into account clustering 8 cores together gives the best energy-delay product, whereas when cost is taken into account configuring clusters with 4 cores gives the best EDA2P and EDAP.},

Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate new scheduling algorithms that can manage the future workloads on HPC systems.

The integration of energy measurment mechanisms on RJMS and the consideration of energy consumption as a new characteristic in accounting seemed primordial at this time when energy has become a bottleneck to scalability.

One challenge is that PUE does not account for the power distribution and cooling losses inside IT equipment. This is particularly problematic in the HPC (high performance computing) space where system suppliers are moving cooling and power subsystems into or out of the cluster. This paper proposes two new metrics: ITUE (IT-power usage effectiveness), similar to PUE but “inside” the IT and TUE (total-power usage effectiveness), which combines the two for a total efficiency picture. We conclude with a demonstration of the method, and a case study of measurements at ORNL’s Jaguar system. TUE provides a ratio of total energy, (internal and external support energy uses) and the specific energy used in the HPC. TUE can also be a means for comparing HPC site to HPC site.},

We also investigate the effectiveness of power-aware systems in managing the energy consumption of different types of map-reduce jobs. We comprehend that for some jobs the energy efficiency degrades at high degree of parallelism, and for some it improves at low CPU frequency.

	abstract = {Cloud computing continues to play a major role in transforming the IT industry by facilitating elastic on-demand provisioning of computational resources including processors, storage and networks. This is necessarily accompanied by the creation, and refreshes, of large-scale systems including cluster, grids and datacenters from which such resources are provided. These systems consume substantial amounts of energy, with associated costs, leading to significant CO2 emissions. In 2014, these systems consumed 70billion kWh of energy in US; this is 1.8\% of the US total energy consumption, and future consumption is expected to continue around this level with approximately 73billion kWh by 2020. The energy bills for major cloud service providers are typically the second largest item in their budgets due to the increased number of computational resources. Energy efficiency in these systems serves the providers interests in saving money to enable reinvestment, reduce supply costs and also reduces CO2 emissions. In this paper, we discuss energy consumption in large scale computing systems, such as scientific high performance computing systems, clusters, grids and clouds, and whether it is possible to decrease energy consumption without detrimental impact on service quality and performance. We discuss a number of approaches, reported in the literature, that claim to improve the energy efficiency of such large scale computing systems, and identify a number of open challenges. Key findings include: (i) in clusters and grids, use of system level efficiency techniques might increase their energy consumption; (ii) in (virtualized) clouds, efficient scheduling and resource allocation can lead to substantially greater economies than consolidation through migration; and (iii) in clusters, switching off idle resources is more energy efficient, however in (production) clouds, performance is affected due to demand fluctuation.},

Therefore improving energy efficiency and minimizing energy consumption when executing each MapReduce job is a critical concern for data centers. We propose a control model based on model prediction control (MPC) for improving energy efficiency of Hadoop cluster while satisfying performance goal. The controller can dynamically scale CPU frequency in facing the workloads changes. The wavelet neural network is utilized to build the prediction model, which can accurately estimate energy efficiency ratio based on the features extracting from the variation of Hadoop workloads. With the help of a wavelet neural network, the controller can guarantee the energy efficiency ratio converges to an ideal set point within a finite settling time. We perform the extensive experiments on a Hadoop cluster to compare our controller with the previous MPC controller. The results demonstrate that our controller outperforms the baseline on energy efficiency control and adapts to workloads of Hadoop cluster.},

We consider how MapReduce efficiency varies with two runtime configurations: resource allocation that changes the number of available concurrent workers, and DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling) that adjusts the processor frequency based on the workloads' computational needs. Our experimental results indicate significant energy savings can be achieved from judicious resource allocation and intelligent DVFS scheduling for computation intensive applications, though the level of improvements depends on both workload characteristic of the MapReduce application and the policy of resource and DVFS scheduling.},

	abstract = {Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) presents unique challenges to the existing energy-conservation techniques and makes it hard to scale-down servers. We propose an energy-conserving, hybrid, logical multi-zoned variant of HDFS for managing dataprocessing intensive, commodity Hadoop cluster. Green HDFS’s data-classiﬁcation-driven data placement allows scale-down by guaranteeing substantially long periods (several days) of idleness in a subset of servers in the datacenter designated as the Cold Zone. These servers are then transitioned to high-energy-saving, inactive power modes. This is done without impacting the performance of the Hot zone as studies have shown that the servers in the data-intensive compute clusters are under-utilized and, hence, opportunities exist for better consolidation of the workload on the Hot Zone. Analysis of the traces of a Yahoo! Hadoop cluster showed signiﬁcant heterogeneity in the data’s access patterns which can be used to guide energy-aware data placement policies. The trace-driven simulation results with three-month-long reallife HDFS traces from a Hadoop cluster at Yahoo! show a 26\% energy consumption reduction by doing only Cold zone power management. Analytical cost model projects savings of \$14.6 million in 3-year total cost of ownership (TCO) and simulation results extrapolate savings of \$2.4 million annually when GreenHDFS technique is applied across all Hadoop clusters (amounting to 38000 servers) at Yahoo.},

	abstract = {Designing real-time systems is a challenging task and many conflicting issues arise in the process. Among them, the most fundamental one is the adjustment of appropriate values for task parameters such as task periods, deadlines, and computation times that directly influence the system feasibility. Task periods and deadlines are generally known at design stage and remains fixed throughout, however, task computation times fluctuates significantly. For a better quality of service or higher system utilization, higher task computation values are required, while this flexibility comes at the price of system infeasibility. To the best of our knowledge, no optimal solution exists for extracting the optimal task computation times in a given range so that the overall system remains feasible under a specific scheduling algorithm. In this paper, we present a generalized bound on the task schedulability defined as a nonlinear inequality hi≤0 in the space of the execution times ci. Based on this bound, the adjustment problem of tasks execution times, which determines the optimum cifor a better system performance while still meeting all temporal requirements, is addressed by solving the standard nonlinear constrained optimization problem. Simulations on synthetic task sets are presented to compare the performance of our work with the most celebrated result, i.e., LL-bound by Liu and Layland in (J. ACM 20(1):40–61, 1973).},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is a commercial and economic paradigm that has gained traction since 2006 and is presently the most significant technology in IT sector. From the notion of cloud computing to its energy efficiency, cloud has been the subject of much discussion. The energy consumption of data centres alone will rise from 200 TWh in 2016 to 2967 TWh in 2030. The data centres require a lot of power to provide services, which increases CO2 emissions. In this survey paper, software-based technologies that can be used for building green data centers and include power management at individual software level has been discussed. The paper discusses the energy efficiency in containers and problem-solving approaches used for reducing power consumption in data centers. Further, the paper also gives details about the impact of data centers on environment that includes the e-waste and the various standards opted by different countries for giving rating to the data centers. This article goes beyond just demonstrating new green cloud computing possibilities. Instead, it focuses the attention and resources of academia and society on a critical issue: long-term technological advancement. The article covers the new technologies that can be applied at the individual software level that includes techniques applied at virtualization level, operating system level and application level. It clearly defines different measures at each level to reduce the energy consumption that clearly adds value to the current environmental problem of pollution reduction. This article also addresses the difficulties, concerns, and needs that cloud data centres and cloud organisations must grasp, as well as some of the factors and case studies that influence green cloud usage.},

	abstract = {Cloud Computing has emerged as a computing paradigm where services are provided through the internet in recent years. Offering on-demand services has transformed the IT companies' working environment, leading to a linearly increasing trend of its usage. The provisioning of the Computing infrastructure is achieved with the help of virtual machines. A great figure of physical devices is required to satisfy the users' resource requirements. To meet the requirements of the submitted workloads that are usually dynamic, the cloud data centers cause the over-provisioning of cloud resources. The result of this over-provisioning is the resource wastage with an increase in the levels of energy consumption, causing a raised operational cost. High CO2 emissions result from this huge energy consumption by data centers, posing a threat to environmental stability. The environmental concern demands for the controlled energy consumption, which can be attained by optimal usage of resources to achieve in the server load, by minimizing the number of active nodes, and by minimizing the frequency of switching between active and de-active server mode in the data center. Motivated by these actualities, we discuss numerous statistical, deterministic, probabilistic, machine learning and optimization based computational solutions for the cloud computing environment. A comparative analysis of the computational methods, on the basis of architecture, consolidation step involved, objectives achieved, simulators involved and resources utilized, has also been presented. A taxonomy for virtual machine (VM) consolidation has also been derived in this research article followed by emerging challenges and research gaps in the field of VM consolidation in cloud computing environment.},

	abstract = {One of the upcoming technologies is ‘Cloud Computing’ which has seen enormous growth in the recent years with an aim to deliver computing as a utility. Fulfilling this technological demand is not an easy task. Huge data centers consisting large volume of data, large number of servers and various other auxiliary hard ware constitutes the infrastructure needed to support Cloud Computing. The datacenters are set up on a large-scale consisting of many computing nodes and use a tremendous quantity of electrical power which led to higher operational outlays. This increase in energy consumption, demands to rethink the energy efficiency of cloud infrastructures. Nevertheless, we need to analyze the current status prior to changing anything to the infrastructure. One of the key research issues that the cloud computing researchers have been trying to resolve is the reduction of the carbon emission by the data centers. This paper discusses the modern systems, which are developed for the improvement of energy efficiency in case of large scale cloud computing infrastructures while not compromising the quality of services and performance, by investigating all possible areas in the cloud infrastructure responsible for the considerable quantity of energy consumption. A comparative analysis of different survey papers published in recent times is carried out and their key contributions are also reported. It also discusses the various tools that are employed for the designing of energy-efficient schemes. Based on the recent trends of energy-efficient algorithms, futuristic scope in the domain is also provided for the cloud computing research community.},

	abstract = {Traditional data centers are shifted toward the cloud computing paradigm. These data centers support the increasing demand for computational and data storage that consumes a massive amount of energy at a huge cost to the cloud service provider and the environment. Considerable energy is wasted to constantly operate idle virtual machines (VMs) on hosts during periods of low load. Dynamic consolidation of VMs from overloaded or underloaded hosts is an effective strategy for improving energy consumption and resource utilization in cloud data centers. The dynamic consolidation of VM from an overloaded host directly influences the service level agreements (SLAs), utilization of resources, and quality of service (QoS) delivered by the system. We proposed an algorithm, namely, GradCent, based on the Stochastic Gradient Descent technique. This algorithm is used to develop an upper CPU utilization threshold for detecting overloaded hosts by using a real CPU workload. Moreover, we proposed a dynamic VM selection algorithm called Minimum Size Utilization (MSU) for selecting the VMs from an overloaded host for VM consolidation. GradCent and MSU maintain the trade-off between energy consumption minimization and QoS maximization under specified SLA goal. We used the CloudSim simulations with real-world workload traces from more than a thousand PlanetLab VMs. The proposed algorithms minimized energy consumption and SLA violation by 23\% and 27.5\% on average, compared with baseline schemes, respectively.},

	abstract = {Clustering is a well known approach to cope with large nodes density and efficiently conserving energy in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Load balancing is an effective approach for optimizing resources like channel bandwidth, the main objective of this paper is to combine these two valuable approaches in order to significantly improve the main WSN service such as information routing. So, our proposal is a routing protocol in which load traffic is shared among cluster members in order to reduce the dropping probability due to queue overflow at some nodes. To this end, a novel hierarchical approach, called Hierarchical Energy-Balancing Multipath routing protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (HEBM) is proposed. The HEBM approach aims to fulfill the following purposes: decreasing the overall network energy consumption, balancing the energy dissipation among the sensor nodes and as direct consequence: extending the lifetime of the network. In fact, the cluster-heads are optimally determined and suitably distributed over the area of interest allowing the member nodes reaching them with adequate energy dissipation and appropriate load balancing utilization. In addition, nodes radio are turned off for fixed time duration according to sleeping control rules optimizing so their energy consumption. The performance evaluation of the proposed protocol is carried out through the well-known NS2 simulator and the exhibited results are convincing. Like this, the residual energy of sensor nodes was measured every 20 s throughout the duration of simulation, in order to calculate the total number of alive nodes. Based on the simulation results, we concluded that our proposed HEBM protocol increases the profit of energy, and prolongs the network lifetime duration from 32\% to 40\% compared to DEEAC reference protocol and from 25\% to 28\% compared to FEMCHRP protocol. The authors also note that the proposed protocol is 41.7\% better than DEEAC with respect to FND (Fist node die), and 25.5\% better than FEMCHRP with respect to LND (last node die) while maintaining the average data transmission delay. We found also that HEBM achieved 66.5\% and 40.6\% more rounds than DEEAC and FEMCHRP respectively.},

When possible, this load balancing procedure should redistribute the workload with minimal knowledge of the system architecture, to reduce overhead. We propose a generic dynamic load balancing technique for iterative problems, independent from the resource to optimize. Proof of this generalization is given through formalization of the designed technique. A heuristic algorithm is defined based upon this formalization, with a structure that facilitates different objective functions. As a result, swapping the objective function can be done with relatively low effort. This heuristic is implemented to minimize energy consumption in an application. We use this application to solve three different dynamic programming problems with multiple GPUs. The implementation is described and then compared against two different workloads, the homogeneous distribution and another dynamic load balancing technique. Our experimentation shows good results in minimizing the overall energy consumption with low overhead.},

However, the programming of these machines requires considerable effort to get the best results in massively data-parallel applications. Maat is a library that enables OpenCL programmers to efficiently execute single data-parallel kernels using all the available devices on a heterogeneous system. It offers a set of load balancing methods, which perform the data partitioning and distribution among the devices, exploiting more of the performance of the system and consequently reducing execution time. Until now, however, a study of the implications of these on the energy consumption has not been made. Therefore, this paper analyses the energy efficiency of the different load balancing methods compared to a baseline system that uses just a single GPU. To evaluate the impact of the heterogeneity of the system, the GPUs were set to different frequencies. The obtained results show that in all the studied cases there is at least one load balancing method that improves energy efficiency.},

VMs that belong to the servers that may be offloaded are scattered to other active servers provided that the user-perceived performance is sustained. Overall, jobs submitted by users should be consolidated to as few servers as possible and the servers that host no job can be put in stand-by or hibernate mode, thus achieving an overall power reduction.

In order to meet the growing demands of users and reduce the skyrocketing cost of electricity, it is critical to have performance guaranteed and cost-effective job schedulers for clouds. In recent years, there has been a growing body of research which focus on improving resource utilization to improve energy efficiency, system throughput and at the same time meet the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements specified in the Service Level Agreements (SLA). This paper propose a multiple procedure scheduling algorithm which aims to maximize the resource utilization for cloud resources for reduced energy consumption as well as guarantee the execution deadline for cloud jobs modeled as scientific workflows.

	abstract = {A Data Center (DC) can be defined as a cyber-physical "complex" system since within it computing and energy aspects coexist together with their interdependencies. Due to this dual aspect, the measurement of DC energy efficiency is an articulated and open issue, because it involves both Information Technology (IT) and Cooling Technology perspectives. Therefore, the analysis of energy efficiency in DCs, through a set of globally accepted metrics, is an ongoing challenge. In particular, the area of productivity metrics - that are parameters referred to the actual processes of computing, storage and data transfer – needs to be further explored. Moreover, till now none of the existing proposed metrics provides a direct measure of the useful work in a DC. To this purpose, this work aims to investigate and analyze the relationship between different types of server workloads and power consumed by the relative computing nodes (core) used. The paper aims to make a step forward beyond state of the art in productivity metrics and also to server performance and power management, by analyzing the server energy consumption behavior through statistical data analysis. To this purpose in this work real data obtained by experimental campaigns on the ENEA-C.R. Portici facilities have been analyzed.},

In the past ten years, a large number of studies have been done on energy efficiency algorithms, methods, strategies, or techniques. Over the past five years, many scholars have conducted surveys on those energy efficiency strategies from different perspectives. In this paper, we conduct a survey and build the taxonomy on current existing energy efficiency relevant surveys, that is, a survey on surveys of energy efficiency. We classify current existing surveys into five categories, including surveys on the energy efficiency of the whole cloud related systems, surveys on energy efficiency of the certain level or component of the cloud, surveys on all of energy efficient strategies, surveys on a certain energy efficiency techniques, and other energy efficiency related surveys. The survey and taxonomy on the energy efficient relevant surveys conducted in this paper provide comprehensive knowledge on the current level of this research filed. Furthermore, observations are exhibited by the statistic data graphs exacted from the investigated surveys. The observations hidden in those surveys on energy efficiency will make it clear the future research directions in the energy related research field.

Reconfigurable technologies enable hardware specialization with modest non-recurring engineering cost, but their performance and energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art processor architectures remain an open question. In this article, we use FPGAs to evaluate the benefits of building specialized hardware for numerical kernels found in scientific applications. In order to properly evaluate performance, we not only compare Intel Arria 10 and Xilinx U280 performance against Intel Xeon, Intel Xeon Phi, and NVIDIA V100 GPUs, but we also extend the Empirical Roofline Toolkit (ERT) to FPGAs in order to assess our results in terms of the Roofline model. We show design optimization and tuning techniques for peak FPGA performance at reasonable hardware usage and power consumption. As FPGA peak performance is known to be far less than that of a GPU, we also benchmark the energy efficiency of each platform for the scientific kernels comparing against microbenchmark and technological limits. Results show that while FPGAs struggle to compete in absolute terms with GPUs on memory- and compute-intensive kernels, they require far less power and can deliver nearly the same energy efficiency.},

	abstract = {Since its advent in the middle of the 2000's, the Cloud Computing (CC) paradigm is increasingly advertised as THE solution to most IT problems. While High Performance Computing (HPC) centers continuously evolve to provide more computing power to their users, several voices (most probably commercial ones) emit the wish that CC platforms could also serve HPC needs and eventually replace in-house HPC platforms. However, it is still unclear whether the overhead induced by the virtualization layer at the heart of every Cloud middleware suits an environment as high-demanding as an HPC platform. In parallel, with a growing concern for the considerable energy consumed by HPC platforms and data centers, research efforts are targeting green approaches with higher energy efficiency. At this level, virtualization is also emerging as the prominent approach to reduce the energy consumed by consolidating multiple running VM instances on a single server, thus giving credit towards a Cloud-based approach. In this paper, we analyze from an HPC perspective the performance and the energy efficiency of the leading open source Cloud middleware, OpenStack, when compared to a bare-metal (i.e. native) configuration. The conducted experiments were performed on top of the Grid'5000 platform with benchmarking tools that reflect "regular" HPC workloads, i.e. HPCC (which includes the reference HPL bench-mark) and Graph500. Power measurements were also performed in order to quantify the potential energy efficiency of the tested configurations, using the approaches proposed in the Green500 and GreenGraph500 projects. In order to abstract from the specifics of a single architecture, the benchmarks were run using two different hardware configurations, based on Intel and AMD processors. This work extends previous studies dedicated to the evaluation of hypervisors against HPC workloads. The results of this study pleads for in-house HPC platforms running without any virtualized frameworks, assessing that the current implementation of Cloud middleware is not well adapted to the execution of HPC applications.},

	abstract = {High Performance Computing is characterized by the latest technological evolutions in computing architectures and by the increasing needs of applications for computing power. A particular middleware called Resource and Job Management System (RJMS), is responsible for delivering computing power to applications. The RJMS plays an important role in HPC since it has a strategic place in the whole software stack because it stands between the above two layers. However the latest evolutions in hardware and applications layers have provided new levels of complexities to this middleware. Issues like scalability, management of topological constraints, energy efficiency and fault tolerance have to be particularly considered, among others, in order to provide a better system exploitation from both the system and user point of view. This dissertation provides a state of the art upon the fundamental concepts and research issues of Resources and Jobs Management Systems. It provides a multi-level comparison (concepts, functionalities, performance) of some Resource and Jobs Management Systems in High Performance Computing. An important metric to evaluate the work of a RJMS on a platform is the observed system utilization. However studies and logs of production platforms show that HPC systems in general suffer of significant un-utilization rates. Our study deals with these clusters' un-utilization periods by proposing methods to aggregate otherwise un-utilized resources for the benefit of the system or the application. More particularly this thesis explores RJMS level mechanisms: 1) for increasing the jobs valuable computation rates in the high volatile environments of a lightweight grid context, 2) for improving system utilization with malleability techniques and 3) providing energy efficient system management through the exploitation of idle computing machines. The experimentation and evaluation in this type of contexts provide important complexities due to the inter-dependency of multiple parameters that have to be taken into control. In this thesis we have developed a methodology based upon real-scale controlled experimentation with submission of synthetic or real workload traces.},

We design a new service in the PaaS layer for scheduling consumer tasks. In the providers' perspective, incompatibility between specification of physical machine and user requests in cloud leads to problems such as energy-performance trade-off and large power consumption so that profits are decreased. To guarantee Quality of service of users' tasks, and reduce energy efficiency, we proposed to modify Particle Swarm Optimisation to reallocate migrated virtual machines in the overloaded host. We also dynamically consolidate the under-loaded host which provides power saving. Simulation results in CloudSim demonstrated that whatever simulation condition is near to the real environment, our method is able to save as much as 14\% more energy and the number of migrations and simulation time significantly reduces compared with the previous works.},

	abstract = {Computing will be pervasive, and enablers of pervasive computing will be data centers housing computing, networking and storage hardware. The data center of tomorrow is envisaged as one containing thousands of single board computing systems deployed in racks. A data center, with 1000 racks, over 30,000 square feet, would require 10 MW of power to power the computing infrastructure. At this power dissipation, an additional 5 MW would be needed by the cooling resources to remove the dissipated heat. At \$100/MWh, the cooling alone would cost \$4 million per annum for such a data center. The concept of Computing Grid, based on coordinated resource sharing and problem solving in dynamic, multi-institutional virtual organizations, is emerging as the new paradigm in distributed and pervasive computing for scientific as well as commercial applications. We envision a global network of data centers housing an aggregation of computing, networking and storage hardware. The increased compaction of such devices in data centers has created thermal and energy management issues that inhibit sustainability of such a global infrastructure. In this paper, we propose the framework of Energy Aware Grid that will provide a global utility infrastructure explicitly incorporating energy efficiency and thermal management among data centers. Designed around an energy-aware co-allocator, workload placement decisions will be made across the Grid, based on data center energy efficiency coefficients. The coefficient, evaluated by the data center’s resource allocation manager, is a complex function of the data center thermal management infrastructure and the seasonal and diurnal variations. A detailed procedure for implementation of a test case is provided with an estimate of energy savings to justify the economics. An example workload deployment shown in the paper aspires to seek the most energy efficient data center in the global network of data centers. The locality based energy efficiency in a data center is shown to arise from use of ground coupled loops in cold climates to lower ambient temperature for heat rejection e.g. computing and rejecting heat from a data center at nighttime ambient of 20°C. in New Delhi, India while Phoenix, USA is at 45°C. The efficiency in the cooling system in the data center in New Delhi is derived based on lower lift from evaporator to condenser. Besides the obvious advantage due to external ambient, the paper also incorporates techniques that rate the efficiency arising from internal thermo-fluids behavior of a data center in workload placement decision.},

	abstract = {Energy efficient system design in wireless sensor networks has been previously discussed at different levels of the network protocol stack so as to provide the maximum possible lifetime of a given network. This paper proposes a novel idea to save energy through extra re lay nodes by eliminating geometric deficiencies of the given topology. Given the sensing locations, the problem is to determine the optimal locations of relay nodes together with the optimal energy provided to them so that the network is alive during the desired lifetime with minimum total energy. We first formulate the problem as a nonlinear programming problem. We then propose an approximation algorithm based on restricting the locations where the relay nodes are allowed to a square lattice. This algorithm approximates the original problem with performance ratio of as low as 2 by trading complexity. For the parking lot application we consider, the relay nodes provide a significant decrease in the total energy required to achieve a specific lifetime.},

In this paper, we proposed a novel approach named EnaCloud, which enables application live placement dynamically with consideration of energy efficiency in a cloud platform. In EnaCloud, we use a Virtual Machine to encapsulate the application, which supports applications scheduling and live migration to minimize the number of running machines, so as to save energy. Specially, the application placement is abstracted as a bin packing problem, and an energy-aware heuristic algorithm is proposed to get an appropriate solution. In addition, an over-provision approach is presented to deal with the varying resource demands of applications. Our approach has been successfully implemented as useful components and fundamental services in the iVIC platform. Finally, we evaluate our approach by comprehensive experiments based on virtual machine monitor Xen and the results show that it is feasible.},

We study the compute, energy, and carbon impacts of generative AI inference. Using ChatGPT as an exemplar, we create a workload model and compare request direction approaches (Local, Balance, CarbonMin), assessing their power use and carbon impacts. Our workload model shows that for ChatGPT-like services, inference dominates emissions, in one year producing 25x the carbon-emissions of training GPT-3. The workload model characterizes user experience, and experiments show that carbon emissions-aware algorithms (CarbonMin) can both maintain user experience and reduce carbon emissions dramatically (35\%). We also consider a future scenario (2035 workload and power grids), and show that CarbonMin can reduce emissions by 56\%. In both cases, the key is intelligent direction of requests to locations with low-carbon power. Combined with hardware technology advances, CarbonMin can keep emissions increase to only 20\% compared to 2022 levels for 55x greater workload. Finally we consider datacenter headroom to increase effectiveness of shifting. With headroom, CarbonMin reduces 2035 emissions by 71\%.},

	abstract = {Buildings represent one of the most important energy consumers (about 40\% and 55\% of total U.S. and European energy consumption, respectively) and are regarded as non-negligible greenhouse gases emitters (39\% of total greenhouse gases emission in U.S.). Hence, it becomes crucial to control buildings energy consumption in order to preserve energy resources and reduce greenhouse gases. For this reason, we propose in this paper a real time Consumer-Dependent Energy Management System (CD-EMS) in MicroGrids (i.e. a restricted form of the power grid) for smart buildings. The main new idea is to find a trade-off between the energy cost, either renewable or non-renewable, and its carbon impact. The other innovation is to transform the building manager to a Consum-Actor who participates directly on reducing greenhouse gas emission by fixing a consumer’s acceptability margin that allows buying renewable energy, even if it is a little more expensive than non-renewable one. CD-EMS offers the best compromise between decreasing energy cost and reducing gas emissions. The problem is modeled as a linear program, resolved by Matlab, and implemented in a small-scale datacenter building prototype. The obtained results show a noticeable improvement in terms of cost and carbon impact where we prove that our system is able to reduce cost until 7.3\%, and CO2 emission until 55.7\%.},

	abstract = {The computation demand for machine learning (ML) has grown rapidly recently, which comes with a number of costs. Estimating the energy cost helps measure its environmental impact and finding greener strategies, yet it is challenging without detailed information. We calculate the energy use and carbon footprint of several recent large models-T5, Meena, GShard, Switch Transformer, and GPT-3-and refine earlier estimates for the neural architecture search that found Evolved Transformer. We highlight the following opportunities to improve energy efficiency and CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e): Large but sparsely activated DNNs can consume {\textless}1/10th the energy of large, dense DNNs without sacrificing accuracy despite using as many or even more parameters. Geographic location matters for ML workload scheduling since the fraction of carbon-free energy and resulting CO2e vary {\textasciitilde}5X-10X, even within the same country and the same organization. We are now optimizing where and when large models are trained. Specific datacenter infrastructure matters, as Cloud datacenters can be {\textasciitilde}1.4-2X more energy efficient than typical datacenters, and the ML-oriented accelerators inside them can be {\textasciitilde}2-5X more effective than off-the-shelf systems. Remarkably, the choice of DNN, datacenter, and processor can reduce the carbon footprint up to {\textasciitilde}100-1000X. These large factors also make retroactive estimates of energy cost difficult. To avoid miscalculations, we believe ML papers requiring large computational resources should make energy consumption and CO2e explicit when practical. We are working to be more transparent about energy use and CO2e in our future research. To help reduce the carbon footprint of ML, we believe energy usage and CO2e should be a key metric in evaluating models, and we are collaborating with MLPerf developers to include energy usage during training and inference in this industry standard benchmark.},

Broadly, carbon emissions have two sources: operational energy consumption, and hardware manufacturing and infrastructure. Although carbon emissions from the former are decreasing thanks to algorithmic, software, and hardware innovations that boost performance and power efficiency, the overall carbon footprint of computer systems continues to grow. This work quantifies the carbon output of computer systems to show that most emissions related to modern mobile and data-center equipment come from hardware manufacturing and infrastructure.

	abstract = {The storage of agricultural machinery (AM) poses a critical operational challenge that requires attention to attain China's “Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutrality” objectives, due to the carbon emissions and fuel consumption associated with AM operations. Nevertheless, this matter has not garnered adequate consideration. Existing studies have rarely focused on optimizing the parking locations for AM to mitigate emissions and advance sustainability. This study employs the TOPSIS-MCGP method to explore sustainable location selection for Chinese AM sheds. The principal factors influencing location selection include carbon emissions, fuel consumption, operational distance, total cost, and timeliness, which were thoroughly examined for their impact. A weighted selection approach was utilized to ascertain key factors and their optimization implications. The AM shed location within the AM dispatching system was developed through the following steps: (1) Evaluation of influential factors for sustainable AM dispatching, encompassing carbon emissions, fuel consumption rate, AM dispatching distance, cost, and timeliness. (2) Quantification of the manager's experience in the AM service center as an index weight using the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM). (3) Adoption of the TOPSIS-MCGP model to establish the relationship between operation points and AM shed locations during sustainable AM operations. A preliminary investigation was carried out in a company located in Harbin City, yielding an optimal solution encompassing a 13,500 mu working area, 3,300 total building area, and a 28-million RMB investment. The outcomes underscore the model's compatibility and its utility for optimizing sustainable AM service operations. In conclusion, this study underscores the significance of addressing AM storage to foster sustainability and emissions reduction. The TOPSIS-MCGP approach proves effective in selecting sustainable AM shed locations. By considering diverse factors like carbon emissions, fuel consumption, operational distance, total cost, and timeliness, companies can enhance their AM dispatching systems, contributing to China's “Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutrality” ambition.},

However, to achieve this lowcarbon goal, it would not be effective without appropriate incentives and the effective demand side involvement. Meanwhile, uncertainties in the system operation such as outputs of intermittent renewable energy, electric vehicles (EVs), and demand side behaviors introduce difﬁculty for scheduling, and further inﬂuence the system's carbon emission. This pa-per proposes a two-stage model to investigate the dynamic carbon impacts caused by the above uncertainties to system scheduling through active demand side from both the economic aspect and environmental aspect.

The uncertainties are modeled as individual probability distributions, and the electricity consumption is forecasted by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-quantile regression neural network (QRNN). To address the system uncertainties, a probability-weighted robust optimization (PWRO) approach is applied. Case studies are tested on a modiﬁed IEEE-33 bus system, the simulation result indicates that the proposed model with PWRO can effectively handle uncertainties, while a fairer bill plan for customers towards a low-carbon economy can be obtained.},

While work and challenges remain on this avenue, research and industry are actively working on the next step of reducing carbon embedded in servers and racks. At a high level, a promising direction to reduce embodied carbon is to avoid emissions from new manufacturing, which often requires using existing components, devices, and buildings for longer. However, much of the data around carbon breakdowns and reduction opportunities remains silo-ed, leading to speculations and assumptions - both internally and externally - around the opportunities to reduce datacenter carbon intensity.

	abstract = {Recent years have seen a surge in the popularity of commercial AI products based on generative, multi-purpose AI systems promising a unified approach to building machine learning (ML) models into technology. However, this ambition of "generality" comes at a steep cost to the environment, given the amount of energy these systems require and the amount of carbon that they emit. In this work, we propose the first systematic comparison of the ongoing inference cost of various categories of ML systems, covering both task-specific (i.e. finetuned models that carry out a single task) and `general-purpose' models, (i.e. those trained for multiple tasks). We measure deployment cost as the amount of energy and carbon required to perform 1,000 inferences on representative benchmark dataset using these models. We find that multi-purpose, generative architectures are orders of magnitude more expensive than task-specific systems for a variety of tasks, even when controlling for the number of model parameters. We conclude with a discussion around the current trend of deploying multi-purpose generative ML systems, and caution that their utility should be more intentionally weighed against increased costs in terms of energy and emissions. All the data from our study can be accessed via an interactive demo to carry out further exploration and analysis.},

We design a linear program to optimize cloud dimensioning over one year, considering worldwide locations for data centers, real-life workload traces, and solar irradiation values.

	abstract = {The advent of cloud computing has provided people around the world with unprecedented access to computational power and enabled rapid growth in technologies such as machine learning, the computational demands of which incur a high energy cost and a commensurate carbon footprint. As a result, recent scholarship has called for better estimates of the greenhouse gas impact of AI: data scientists today do not have easy or reliable access to measurements of this information, which precludes development of actionable tactics. We argue that cloud providers presenting information about software carbon intensity to users is a fundamental stepping stone towards minimizing emissions. In this paper, we provide a framework for measuring software carbon intensity, and propose to measure operational carbon emissions by using location-based and time-specific marginal emissions data per energy unit. We provide measurements of operational software carbon intensity for a set of modern models covering natural language processing and computer vision applications, and a wide range of model sizes, including pretraining of a 6.1 billion parameter language model. We then evaluate a suite of approaches for reducing emissions on the Microsoft Azure cloud compute platform: using cloud instances in different geographic regions, using cloud instances at different times of day, and dynamically pausing cloud instances when the marginal carbon intensity is above a certain threshold. We confirm previous results that the geographic region of the data center plays a significant role in the carbon intensity for a given cloud instance, and find that choosing an appropriate region can have the largest operational emissions reduction impact. We also present new results showing that the time of day has meaningful impact on operational software carbon intensity.Finally, we conclude with recommendations for how machine learning practitioners can use software carbon intensity information to reduce environmental impact.},

	abstract = {Data centers are becoming considerably more significant and energy-intensive due to the exponential growth of cloud computing. Cloud computing allows people to access computer resources on demand. It provides amenities on the pay-as-you-go basis across the data center locations spread over the world. Consequently, cloud data centers consume a lot of electricity and leave a proportional carbon impact on the environment. There is a need to investigate efficient energy-saving approaches to reduce the massive energy usage in cloud servers. This review paper focuses on identifying the research done in the field of energy consumption (EC) using different techniques of machine learning, heuristics, metaheuristics, and statistical methods. Host CPU utilization prediction, underload/overload detection, virtual machine selection, migration, and placement have been performed to manage the resources and achieve efficient energy utilization. In this review, energy savings achieved by different techniques are compared. Many researchers have tried various methods to reduce energy usage and service level agreement violations (SLAV) in cloud data centers. By using the heuristic approach, researchers have saved 5.4\% to 90\% of energy with their proposed methods compared with the existing methods. Similarly, the metaheuristic approaches reduce energy consumption from 7.68\% to 97\%, the machine learning methods from 1.6\% to 88.5\%, and the statistical methods from 5.4\% to 84\% when compared to the benchmark approaches for a variety of settings and parameters. So, making energy use more efficient could cut down the air pollution, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and even the amount of water needed to make power. The overall outcome of this review work is to understand different methods used by researchers to save energy in cloud data centers.},

Resources in data centers typically focus on providing high performance and availability, but the question of sustainability in managing these distributed resources often goes unnoticed over these other metrics. This problem will only exacerbate as the data center computing demand continues to increase. In this paper, we address the sustainability aspect of load balancing in VMware's Avi Global Server Load Balancer (GSLB). Our GSLB deployment spans data centers across geographies and clouds and relies on geographical proximity to shift client application requests to the closest data center. In this work, we enhance the GSLB service to additionally consider the real-time carbon intensity at each data center as a factor in making a load-balancing choice. Our carbon-aware prototype shows an average of 21\% and a maximum of 51\% reduction in carbon emissions while operating with an acceptable latency.},

In this paper, we present a model where data centers shift load independently of the ISOs. We first consider the impact of load shifting guided by locational marginal carbon emissions, λCO2, a sensitivity metric that measures the impact of incremental load shifts. Relative to previous models for data center load shifting, the presented model improves accuracy and includes more realistic assumptions regarding the operation of data centers and electricity markets. Further, we introduce a benchmark model where data centers have access to the full information about the power system and can identify optimal shifts for the current time period. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model on the IEEE RTS-GMLC system using 5 min load and generation data for an entire year. Our results show that the proposed improvements for the shifting model based on λCO2 are highly effective, leading to results that outperform the benchmark model.},

This paper presents a novel method for load balancing based on the selection of dynamic points. This method emphasizes energy efficiency and quality output by minimum utilization of network utility grids. This proposed load-balancing approach tries to balance network services based on the base station (BS) coordination method in a cluster. Cel-sleep technology is intended to conserve energy by disconnecting weakly charged base stations (BS) in situations when traffic is low. The suggested CoMP algorithm for load balancing expertly manages resource allocation for new users and improves energy efficiency. System-level simulations show that the proposed design enables a scalable trade-off between radio efficiency and energy efficiency, reduces grid energy usage by 22\%, and boosts the ES score by 32\%.},

	abstract = {The global COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the way businesses utilize digital technologies, with an increasing reliance on cloud resources due to the paradigm shift from traditional to work-from-home models. Cloud computing resources are expected to expand annually by 14.8{\textbackslash}\% from 2022 to 2030, a three-fold increase overall, driven by more and more reliance on decentralization and the changing workplace. As the need for large scale systems continues to grow, the cost, energy consumption and carbon footprint have increased accordingly at unprecedented rates. It is expected that digital industry will contribute to 14{\textbackslash}\% of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. Therefore, it is essential to put sustainability at the core of digital technologies and reduce their operating cost and negative impact on environment. In the past decades, scientists and industry pioneers have made tremendous endeavors in improving the energy efficiency of various digital technologies. The exemplary achievements including, but not limited, to using more energy efficient hardware such as GPUs, FPGAs, and AISCs to solve appropriate problems, using Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) as a metric to measure the energy efficiency of data centers, using the big.LITTLE architecture to balance the high performance and low power needs of mobile applications, using Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to decrease energy consumption based on overall system load, using virtual machines to share resources in the cloud, using carbon-aware scheduling to allocate jobs to the least wasteful or most carbon efficient resources, as well as neuromorphic computing that mimics a human brain to minimize the energy consumption of AI applications. All these works have significantly advanced the research and industry practices of sustainable computing. However, the ever growing data volume and more complex workloads running on large scale systems have brought the challenges to a whole new level. How to improve the carbon, cost, and energy efficiency of large scale systems from the big data and workload analysis perspective has not been fully studied in the literature. This dissertation explores ways to improve energy efficiency via workload analysis, which provide the additional benefits of improving carbon emissions and lowering operational costs for both large systems and the end-users relying on those system. More specifically, it investigates three typical workloads that have high energy requirements and are widely deployed: website workloads, cloud workloads, and AI workloads. The study of website workloads monitored the power consumption of five different types of web servers and recorded the quality of service (QoS) provided by those servers while simulating real user load. The results demonstrated that a low-powered web server can provide comparable QoS to a higher powered one in many instances. For private cloud workloads, the 2017 and 2018 Alibaba cluster traces were analyzed, and a simulator was designed to test the effectiveness of decreasing the number of servers while maintaining the required level of performance. The simulation results showed that decreasing the number of servers by 5{\textbackslash}\% resulted in negligible impact on performance while lowering yearly electricity costs. A public cloud workload analysis was conducted using the 2019 Microsoft Azure trace, which revealed that a large portion of VMs was underutilized thus wasting significant amount of energy and resources in the cloud. A recommendation algorithm was proposed to help cloud users reduce cost without compromising QoS. Lastly, the energy efficiency and carbon emissions of several foundation AI models were analyzed using the recently released industry standard - Software Carbon Intensity (SCI), which provided an effective methodology on evaluating the environmental impact of large-scale AI models and shed lights on future design of green AI.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has revolutionized data storage, processing, and access in modern data center operations. Conventional data centers use enormous amounts of energy for server operation, power supply, and cooling. The processors produce heat while processing the data and therefore increase the center’s carbon footprint, and the rising energy usage and carbon emissions caused by data centers pose serious environmental challenges. Under these circumstances, energy-efficient green data centers are being used as a phenomenal source of sustainable modernization. This study proposes the implementation of the Green Energy Efficiency and Carbon Optimization (GEECO) model for enhancing energy usage. Within the data center, the GEECO model dynamically adjusts workload distribution and task assignment to balance performance and manage service-level reconciliation. The ability to identify possibilities for energy optimization and carbon emission reduction is possible through real-time monitoring of energy usage and workload demand. The results revealed a considerable increase in energy efficiency, with significant decreases in energy usage and related costs. The GEECO model provides a significant improvement in energy consumption and carbon emission reduction for the different introduced scenarios. This model’s introduction to practical application would be made possible by these improvements in the quantitative results. The approach of this study also has a positive impact on the environment by reducing carbon emissions. The resilience and practicality of the solution are also analyzed, highlighting the probability of widespread adoption and its associated improvements in the advancement of sustainable cloud computing.},

	abstract = {Large-scale computing systems such as data centers are facing increasing pressure to cap their carbon footprint. Integrating emerging clean energy solutions into computer system design therefore gains great significance in the green computing era. While some pioneering work on tracking variable power budget show promising energy efficiency, they are not suitable for data centers due to lack of performance guarantee when renewable generation is low and fluctuant. In addition, our characterization of wind power behavior reveals that data centers designed to track the intermittent renewable power incur up to 4X performance loss due to inefficient and redundant load matching activities. As a result, mitigating operational overhead while still maintaining desired energy utilization becomes the most significant challenge in managing server clusters on intermittent renewable energy generation. In this paper we take a first step in digging into the operational overhead of renewable energy powered data center. We propose iSwitch, a lightweight server power management that follows renewable power variation characteristics, leverages existing system infrastructures, and applies supply/load cooperative scheme to mitigate the performance overhead. Comparing with state-of-the-art renewable energy driven system design, iSwitch could mitigate average network traffic by 75\%, peak network traffic by 95\%, and reduce 80\% job waiting time while still maintaining 96\% renewable energy utilization. We expect that our work can help computer architects make informed decisions on sustainable and high-performance system design.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing supports the fast expansion of data and computer centers; therefore, energy and load balancing are vital concerns. The growing popularity of cloud computing has raised power usage and network costs. Frequent calls for computational resources may cause system instability; further, load balancing in the host requires migrating virtual machines (VM) from overloaded to underloaded hosts, which affects energy usage. The proposed cost-efficient whale optimization algorithm for virtual machine (CEWOAVM) technique helps to more effectively place migrating virtual machines. CEWOAVM optimizes system resources such as CPU, storage, and memory. This study proposes energy-aware virtual machine migration with the use of the WOA algorithm for dynamic, cost-effective cloud data centers in order to solve this problem. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm saved 18.6\%, 27.08\%, and 36.3\% energy when compared with the PSOCM, RAPSO-VMP, and DTH-MF algorithms, respectively. It also showed 12.68\%, 18.7\%, and 27.9\% improvements for the number of virtual machine migrations and 14.4\%, 17.8\%, and 23.8\% reduction in SLA violation, respectively.},

	url = {http://theses.ncl.ac.uk/jspui/handle/10443/2782},
	abstract = {Energy costs now dominate IT infrastructure total cost of ownership, with datacentre 
operators predicted to spend more on energy than hardware infrastructure in the 
next five years. With Western European datacentre power consumption estimated at 
56 TWh/year in 2007 and projected to double by 2020, improvements in energy efficiency 
of IT operations is imperative. The issue is further compounded by social and 
political factors and strict environmental legislation governing organisations. 
One such example of large IT systems includes high-throughput cycle stealing distributed 
systems such as HTCondor and BOINC, which allow organisations to leverage 
spare capacity on existing infrastructure to undertake valuable computation. 
As a consequence of increased scrutiny of the energy impact of these systems, aggressive 
power management policies are often employed to reduce the energy impact 
of institutional clusters, but in doing so these policies severely restrict the computational 
resources available for high-throughput systems. These policies are often configured 
to quickly transition servers and end-user cluster machines into low power 
states after only short idle periods, further compounding the issue of reliability. 
In this thesis, we evaluate operating policies for energy efficiency in large-scale 
computing environments by means of trace-driven discrete event simulation, leveraging 
real-world workload traces collected within Newcastle University. 
The major contributions of this thesis are as follows: 
i) Evaluation of novel energy efficient management policies for a decentralised 
peer-to-peer (P2P) BitTorrent environment. 
ii) Introduce a novel simulation environment for the evaluation of energy efficiency 
of large scale high-throughput computing systems, and propose a generalisable 
model of energy consumption in high-throughput computing systems. 
iii 
iii) Proposal and evaluation of resource allocation strategies for energy consumption 
in high-throughput computing systems for a real workload. 
iv) Proposal and evaluation for a realworkload ofmechanisms to reduce wasted task 
execution within high-throughput computing systems to reduce energy consumption. 
v) Evaluation of the impact of fault tolerance mechanisms on energy consumption.},

This challenge must be met in a cost-effective manner and without undue environmental impact. This paper quantifies the operational benefits of the Capacity to Customers (C2C) project presently being led by Electricity North West Limited in the UK. The objective of the project is to use demand-side response (DSR) technology and increased network interconnection to significantly increase the available network capacity, avoiding the cost and environmental impact of traditional reinforcement. Through the analysis of real distribution circuit data for a cross-section of circuits involved in the project trial, and assuming evenly-distributed load growth, it is shown that the presence of DSR increases usable circuit capacity by a mean of 66\%. The use of network interconnection generally reduces the number of steady-state voltage constraints and thereby yields a further increase in capacity. Consequently, it is shown that interconnection significantly reduces the need for cable and overhead line reinforcement, often needed for connecting relatively large industrial and commercial loads. The paper also comments on protection issues that could potentially impact upon C2C deployment.},

The order of menu ingredients was changed twice: for five weeks, from the most to the least impactful in terms of carbon footprint; subsequently, for another five weeks the order was reversed. At both times, all sales data were recorded. A total of 279,219 and 288,527 items were selected, respectively, during the first and the second intervention. A significant association was found between menu re-ordering and customers’ choices for almost all food categories considered. Overall, despite beef choices not changing, results showed that students were more likely to choose low-carbon options when these were placed at the beginning, emphasizing that food selections were impacted by ingredient placement on the menu list. These findings highlight the need for a multi-level strategy focused on raising students’ awareness of the environmental impact of animal-based foods, particularly beef.},

	abstract = {The carbon footprint of software activities is determined by embodied and operational emissions of hardware resources. This paper presents cMemento, a concept that enables operating systems to make carbon-aware memory placement decisions. Main memory has become heterogeneous in today's computer systems. In addition to traditional (and volatile) main memory (e.g. DRAM), novel memory technologies with persistent properties are often also available (e.g. PRAM, FRAM, MRAM). Complementary, there are a large number of new memory interfaces (e.g. high-bandwidth, graphics, and low-power memory) that have to be additionally taken into account by the operating system when allocating memory. The availability of new memory technologies and interfaces enables systems with improved energy efficiency. At the same time, the new memory interfaces have revealed serious flaws in the current state-of-the-art memory abstractions in operating systems. Hence, moving away from the homogeneous perspective of memory resources is a crucial step towards significantly reducing the energy consumption and, ultimately, the carbon footprint of today's computer systems. With cMemento, we propose an approach that combines information on characteristics of (i) active workloads and (ii) available memory resources with a carbon model. cMemento transforms the combined information into memory placement decisions at operating system level. The placement decisions that are made result in improved operating conditions (i.e. better energy efficiency and lower carbon footprint) for the available memory resources.},

How to improve high-throughput computing resource allocation strategy was taken into account. High-throughput computing resource consolidation is an effective method to increase resource utilization and in turn reduces energy consumption and increases revenue acquisition. However, high-throughput computing resource consolidation may lead to several problems, such as the freeing up of resources that can sit idling yet still drawing power and the energy consumption of communication and revenue acquisition are ignored. Based on these considerations, this paper proposes a Particle Swarm Optimized Tabu search Mechanism, aiming to maximize resource utilization and explicitly taking into account both active and idle energy consumption in minimizing finish time. While fulfilling requirements and QoS of cloud datacenter, this proposed mechanism allows turning off the spare servers, thus reducing power consumption and increasing revenue enhancing overall datacenter. We conducted extensive experiments based on the platform of CloudSim. By comparing with traditional algorithms, we prove that proposed algorithm can save energy consumption reducing by 67.5\% and increase revenue enhancing by 8.14 times averagely based on the consideration of communication and QoS of cloud datacenter in minimizing finish time.},

Virtual machines (VMs) comprise the backend of most, if not all, cloud computing services. Several VMs are often consolidated on a physical machine to efficiently utilize its resources. In this paper, we take into account the cooling and network structure of the datacenter host ing the physical machines when consolidating the VMs so that fewer racks and routers are employed, without compromising the service-level agreements; consequently, idle routing and cooling equipment can be turned off in order to reduce the energy consumption. Our experimental results on four benchmarks show that the proposed techniques improve energy consumption of servers, network equipment, and cooling systems by 2.5\%, 18.8\%, and 28.2\% respectively compared to state of the art, resulting in a total of 14.7\% energy improvement on average in the entire datacenter.},

EQVMP combines three key techniques: (1) hop reduction, (2) energy saving and (3) load balancing. Hop reduction can regroup VMs to lower the traffic load among them. Energy saving techniques aim at choosing the appropriate servers. The proposed load balancing updates VM placement periodically. Our experimental results show that the proposed scheme can lower energy consumption and maintain QoS. We propose an evaluation score [1] to assess VM placement in terms of energy, delay and throughput.

	abstract = {Cloud Computing is revolutionizing how Computing power is generated and consumed over the Internet on a pay-peruse basis over the past few years. The broader acceptance of Cloud technologies has led to the establishment of datacenters. Over the years, high energy consumption by datacenters has become a major interest as a result of increasing demands of resources and services by enterprise and scientific applications. Consequently, datacenter infrastructure turns out to be not only expensive to sustain, but also unfavorable to the surrounding environment due to their huge carbon emission. Thus, energy efficient virtual machine allocation techniques are required to overcome high energy consumption due to improper resource allocation within the data centers. This paper proposes Energy-Efficient Virtual Machine allocation technique using Interior Search Algorithm (ISA) that reduces the datacenter energy consumption and resource underutilization. The results shows that, the energy consumption of GA and BFD is 90\%–95\% as compare to the proposed EE-IS which around 65\%. On average 30\% of energy has been save using EE-IS as well the utilization of the resources which has also improved.},

	abstract = {Job scheduling of MapReduce is a research hot spot, especially on the heterogeneous datacenter. Huge energy consumption and operating costs are key challenges. Most of the previous work only considers the scheduling optimization of a single job. In this paper, we take multiple jobs of MapReduce as research objects and focus on the goal of “jointly optimizing the scheduling time, job costs and energy consumption.” For that, an energy- and locality-efficient MapReduce multi-job scheduling algorithm is developed for the heterogeneous datacenter. Firstly, we use rack as the basic unit of resource in job scheduling to reduce data communication between jobs and to facilitate energy savings. Secondly, according to the capacity of heterogeneous rack, we design a multi-job pre-mapping method to optimize the execution order of jobs and jointly optimize the scheduling time, job costs and energy consumption. Based this pre-mapping method, we can assign one job to the virtual machine on the same rack, so as to minimize the amount of online rack. This centralized mapping strategy is very helpful to save energy and reduce data transmission of jobs. Thirdly, the map and reduce tasks of a job will be divided into multiple task groups for parallel execution, thereby further reducing data communication and energy consumption. Finally, a lot of experimental results prove the advantages of our algorithm.},

	abstract = {With the increasing number of users and application in the era of the Industrial Internet of Things (I-IoT), computing efficiency and energy consumption become two vital problems. Multi-processor heterogeneous system has been widely used for handling parallel workflow applications to advance the performance of system, in which efficient workflow scheduling and the choice of frequency for each task play key roles. However, most scheduling algorithms just focus on an optimal solution for every single task and may exclude optimal task priority sequence at the task sorting phase. Therefore, this paper proposes a Predictive Energy Consumption Scheduling (PECS) algorithm to match the frequency for each task. Firstly, the alterable time space is introduced to decompose the deadline of the whole workflow application into each task. Secondly, as the basis of allocation, Predictive Energy Consumption Matrix (ECM) is defined to predict the impact of current task allocation on the energy consumption of subsequent tasks. Thirdly, the processor with the lowest predicted energy consumption is matched for each task to form a preliminary scheduling scheme with the constraint of time. Finally, all tasks in the same priority level of a processor are swapped in order, then a scheduling strategy is formed to minimize energy consumption. Experimental results reveal that our proposed algorithm can reduce energy 48.28\% and 13.33\% averagely compared with other two state of the art algorithms.},

	abstract = {The limited sensor node energy and the large number of nodes with dynamic network topology information have always been the important design concerns in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Node clustering is an effective way to tackle with the two issues by grouping the nodes into hierarchies in order to reduce communication distance and the amount of message. This paper mainly focuses on the unification of the node energy consumption in WSN. The distributions of the energy consumption for various scenarios in the hierarchical network are analyzed for the first time and two main reasons are found leading to the asymmetry of the energy consumption among nodes. One is the energy consumption from the communications between nodes and base station, and the other is that from the cluster head for receiving data from other nodes. It is concluded that the probability of the node acting as cluster head should depend on the distribution of the head's energy consumption, and a variable sampling space oriented to the potential number of cluster heads is established thereafter. Furthermore, a new clustering algorithm, the Segment Equalization Clustering based on Cluster Head Energy Consumption (SECHEC) algorithm is proposed, which can effectively improve the network lifetime and ensure the availability of the system within its entire lifespan.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing continues to play a major role in transforming the IT industry by facilitating elastic on-demand provisioning of computational resources including processors, storage and networks. This is necessarily accompanied by the creation, and refreshes, of large-scale systems including cluster, grids and datacenters from which such resources are provided. These systems consume substantial amounts of energy, with associated costs, leading to significant CO2 emissions. In 2014, these systems consumed 70billion kWh of energy in US; this is 1.8\% of the US total energy consumption, and future consumption is expected to continue around this level with approximately 73billion kWh by 2020. The energy bills for major cloud service providers are typically the second largest item in their budgets due to the increased number of computational resources. Energy efficiency in these systems serves the providers interests in saving money to enable reinvestment, reduce supply costs and also reduces CO2 emissions. In this paper, we discuss energy consumption in large scale computing systems, such as scientific high performance computing systems, clusters, grids and clouds, and whether it is possible to decrease energy consumption without detrimental impact on service quality and performance. We discuss a number of approaches, reported in the literature, that claim to improve the energy efficiency of such large scale computing systems, and identify a number of open challenges. Key findings include: (i) in clusters and grids, use of system level efficiency techniques might increase their energy consumption; (ii) in (virtualized) clouds, efficient scheduling and resource allocation can lead to substantially greater economies than consolidation through migration; and (iii) in clusters, switching off idle resources is more energy efficient, however in (production) clouds, performance is affected due to demand fluctuation.},

They are not designed for runtime elasticity of heterogeneous workloads comprising both batch and interactive jobs. By runtime elasticity it is meant that resource requirements for a job can change during its execution. This paper examines today's workload models and schedulers from this novel perspective. We show the need for an extended workload model with runtime elasticity. We then propose Delayed-LOS and Hybrid-LOS, two novel scheduling algorithms that improve and build on an existing Dynamic Programming based scheduler (LOS) designed only for batch jobs. While Delayed-LOS improves significantly over LOS, Hybrid-LOS is specifically designed for heterogeneous parallel workloads. We further propose elastic versions of these algorithms that incorporate runtime elasticity as well. Extensive simulations with GridSim framework demonstrate that Delayed-LOS \& Hybrid-LOS improve average utilization by up to 4.1\% \& 4.55\%, thereby reducing mean job-waiting time and slowdown by up to 31.88\% \& 25.31\% and 30.3\% \& 24.29\%, respectively.},

However, this implementation faces tremendous energy consumption, carbon dioxide emission and associated costs concerns. With energy consumption becoming key issue for the operation and maintenance of cloud datacenters, cloud computing providers are becoming profoundly concerned. In this paper, we present formulations and solutions for Green Cloud Environments (GCE) to minimize its environmental impact and energy consumption under new models by considering static and dynamic portions of cloud components. Our proposed methodology captures cloud computing data centers and presents a generic model for them. To implement this objective, an in-depth knowledge of energy consumption patterns in cloud environment is necessary. We investigate energy consumption patterns and show that by applying suitable optimization policies directed through our energy consumption models, it is possible to save 20\% of energy consumption in cloud data centers. Our research results can be integrated into cloud computing systems to monitor energy consumption and support static and dynamic system level-optimization.},

Dynamic and heterogeneous environments, energy efficiency, and delay-sensitivity are the major issues with the CoT. Energy efficiency is one of the basic requirements of IoT applications and resources in the cloud, which is a challenging issue in the CoT. This paper proposes the optimization of energy schemes for the CoT by applying a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Extensive numerical simulation is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the ETCORA algorithm.

	abstract = {Rising energy costs and negative environmental impact resulting from the generation of electricity, particularly when relying on fossil fuels, increase the need for energy-efficient computing. In addition to the optimization of hardware devices, the use of sophisticated software solutions for reducing energy consumption is an important area of current research. Distributing the load among servers for performance optimization is a well-researched area. There is a large potential to reduce energy consumption with similar techniques. In this paper, we examine the application of energy-efficient load-balancing (or unbalancing) strategies for web server requests sent to a web server farm. Single requests usually lead to small fractions of performance need. They are quite suited for strategies relying on the assumption of a fully divisible load. We show that we are able to reduce the power consumption continuously for replays of Wikipedia access traces. Eventually, we are able to reduce the energy consumption in web server farms, significantly.},

The key component of our systems is an algorithm that makes load balancing and unbalancing decisions by considering both the total load imposed on the cluster and the power and performance implications of turning nodes off. The algorithm is implemented in two different ways: (1) at the application level for a cluster-based, localityconscious network server; and (2) at the operating system level for an operating system for clustered cycle servers. Our experimental results are very favorable, showing that our systems conserve both power and energy in comparison to traditional systems.},

This tendency has recently put the pressure on the ability to efficiently manage the power required to operate the huge amount of electrical components associated with state-of-the-art high performance computing systems. The power consumption of a supercomputer needs to be adjusted based on varying power budget or electricity availabilities. As a consequence, Resource and Job Management Systems have to be adequately adapted in order to efficiently schedule jobs with optimized performance while limiting power usage whenever needed. We introduce in this paper a new scheduling strategy that can adapt the executed workload to a limited power budget. The originality of this approach relies upon a combination of speed scaling and node shutdown techniques for power reductions. It is implemented into the widely used resource and job management system SLURM. Finally, it is validated through large scale emulations using real production workload traces of the supercomputer Curie.},

An energy consumption model is proposed to compute the energy consumption for a machine in different states. Then, a non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm is developed to solve the problem. In the non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm, a green scheduling heuristic is presented to optimize the makespan, the energy consumption and the numbers of turning-on/off machines simultaneously.

	abstract = {Job scheduling in data centers can be considered from a cyber–physical point of view, as it affects the data center’s computing performance (i.e. the cyber aspect) and energy efficiency (the physical aspect). Driven by the growing needs to green contemporary data centers, this paper uses recent technological advances in data center virtualization and proposes cyber–physical, spatio-temporal (i.e. start time and servers assigned), thermal-aware job scheduling algorithms that minimize the energy consumption of the data center under performance constraints (i.e. deadlines). Savings are possible by being able to temporally “spread” the workload, assign it to energy-efficient computing equipment, and further reduce the heat recirculation and therefore the load on the cooling systems. This paper provides three categories of thermal-aware energy-saving scheduling techniques: (a) FCFS-Backfill-XInt and FCFS-Backfill-LRH, thermal-aware job placement enhancements to the popular first-come first-serve with back-filling (FCFS-backfill) scheduling policy; (b) EDF-LRH, an online earliest deadline first scheduling algorithm with thermal-aware placement; and (c) an offline genetic algorithm for SCheduling to minimize thermal cross-INTerference (SCINT), which is suited for batch scheduling of backlogs. Simulation results, based on real job logs from the ASU Fulton HPC data center, show that the thermal-aware enhancements to FCFS-backfill achieve up to 25\% savings compared to FCFS-backfill with first-fit placement, depending on the intensity of the incoming workload, while SCINT achieves up to 60\% savings. The performance of EDF-LRH nears that of the offline SCINT for low loads, and it degrades to the performance of FCFS-backfill for high loads. However, EDF-LRH requires milliseconds of operation, which is significantly faster than SCINT, the latter requiring up to hours of runtime depending upon the number and size of submitted jobs. Similarly, FCFS-Backfill-LRH is much faster than FCFS-Backfill-XInt, but it achieves only part of FCFS-Backfill-XInt’s savings.},

This CPU is the same one that powers the Astra supercomputer, the first Arm-based supercomputer entering the Top500 in November 2018. We study from micro-benchmarks up to large production codes. We include an interdisciplinary evaluation of three scientific applications (a finite-element fluid dynamics code, a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, and a lattice Boltzmann code) and the Graph 500 benchmark, focusing on parallel and energy efficiency as well as studying their scalability up to thousands of Armv8 cores. For comparison, we run the same tests on state-of-the-art x86 nodes included in Dibona and the Tier-0 supercomputer MareNostrum4. Our experiments show that the ThunderX2 has a 25\% lower performance on average, mainly due to its small vector unit yet somewhat compensated by its 30\% wider links between the CPU and the main memory. We found that the software ecosystem of the Armv8 architecture is comparable to the one available for Intel. Our results also show that ThunderX2 delivers similar or better energy-to-solution and scalability, proving that Arm-based chips are legitimate contenders in the market of next-generation HPC systems.},

Therefore, many of the power draw and energy consumption traits of HPC applications can be characterized in terms of the power draw and energy consumption of these constituent kernels. Given that power and energy-related constraints have emerged as major design impediments for exascale systems, it is crucial to develop a greater understanding of how kernels behave in terms of power/energy when subjected to different compiler-based optimizations and different hardware settings. In this work, we develop CPU and DIMM power and energy models for three extensively utilized HPC kernels by training artiﬁcial neural networks. These networks are trained using empirical data gathered on the target architecture. The models utilize kernelspeciﬁc compiler-based optimization parameters and hardware tunables as inputs and make predictions for the power draw rate and energy consumption of system components. The resulting power draw and energy usage predictions have an absolute error rate that averages less than 5.5\% for three important kernels – matrix multiplication (MM), stencil computation and LU factorization.},

The objective of this paper is to propose a model to estimate the energy consumption of checkpoint and restart operations and a method for its construction. These estimates allow the evaluation of different scenarios in order to minimize energy consumption. We focus on coordinated checkpoint/restart at the system level, in single-program multiple-data (SPMD) applications, on homogeneous clusters. We study the behavior of the power dissipated by the compute node during a checkpoint/restart operation, as well as its execution time, considering different parameters of the system and the application. The experimentation carried out on two platforms shows the validity of the proposal. We also evaluate the impact on power and energy consumption of the processor's C states, the configuration of the network file system (NFS), where the checkpoint files are stored, and the compression of the checkpoint files. This paper contributes to the objective of predicting energy consumption in the execution of applications that use checkpoint/restart. Not counting the outliers, we can estimate the energy consumed by checkpoint/restart operations with errors lower than 7.5\%.},

	abstract = {Keeping energy costs in budget and operating within available capacities of power distribution and cooling systems is becoming an important requirement for High Performance Computing (HPC) data centers. It is even more important when considering the estimated power requirements for Exascale computing. Power and energy capping are two of emerging techniques aimed towards controlling and efficient budgeting of power and energy consumption within the data center. Implementation of both techniques requires a knowledge of, potentially unknown, power and energy consumption data of the given parallel HPC applications for different numbers of compute servers (nodes).This paper introduces an Adaptive Energy and Power Consumption Prediction (AEPCP) model capable of predicting the power and energy consumption of parallel HPC applications for different number of compute nodes. The suggested model is application specific and describes the behavior of power and energy with respect to the number of utilized compute nodes, taking as an input the available history power/energy data of an application. It provides a generic solution that can be used for each application but it produces an application specific result. The AEPCP model allows for ahead of time power and energy consumption prediction and adapts with each additional execution of the application improving the associated prediction accuracy. The model does not require any application code instrumentation and does not introduce any application performance degradation. Thus it is a high level application energy and power consumption prediction model. The validity and the applicability of the suggested AEPCP model is shown in this paper through the empirical results achieved using two application-benchmarks on the SuperMUC HPC system (the 10th fastest supercomputer in the world, according to Top500 November 2013 rankings) deployed at Leibniz Supercomputing Centre.},

	abstract = {The use of High Performance Computing (HPC) in commercial and consumer IT applications is becoming popular. They need the ability to gain rapid and scalable access to high-end computing capabilities. Cloud computing promises to deliver such a computing infrastructure using data centers so that HPC users can access applications and data from a Cloud anywhere in the world on demand and pay based on what they use. However, the growing demand drastically increases the energy consumption of data centers, which has become a critical issue. High energy consumption not only translates to high energy cost, which will reduce the profit margin of Cloud providers, but also high carbon emissions which is not environmentally sustainable. Hence, energy-efficient solutions are required that can address the high increase in the energy consumption from the perspective of not only Cloud provider but also from the environment. To address this issue we propose near-optimal scheduling policies that exploits heterogeneity across multiple data centers for a Cloud provider. We consider a number of energy efficiency factors such as energy cost, carbon emission rate, workload, and CPU power efficiency which changes across different data center depending on their location, architectural design, and management system. Our carbon/energy based scheduling policies are able to achieve on average up to 30\% of energy savings in comparison to profit based scheduling policies leading to higher profit and less carbon emissions.},

Based on a deep study on VMs placement, a solution is proposed and described in this paper to solve the problem of dynamic placement of VMs toward optimization of their energy consumptions. A computational model of energy consumption is proposed and built. A novel algorithm based on evolutionary game theory is also presented, which successfully addresses the challenges faced by dynamic placement of VMs. It is proved that the proposed algorithm can reach the optimal solutions theoretically. Experimental results also demonstrate that, by adjusting VMs placement dynamically, the energy consumption can be reduced correspondingly. In comparison with the existing state of the arts, our proposed method outperforms other five algorithms tested and achieves savings of 30–40\% on energy consumption.},

We argue that a fair data placement is helpful to save energy, and then we propose three goals of data placement, and a modulo based Data Placement Algorithm (DPA for short) which achieves these goals. Afterwards, the correctness of the proposed DPA is proved from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Three different systems which implement MapReduce model with different DPAs are compared in our experiments.

Virtual machine placement is the key in the server consolidation. In the past few years, many approaches to the virtual machine placement have been proposed. However, existing virtual machine placement approaches to the virtual machine placement problem consider the energy consumption by physical machines in a data center only, but do not consider the energy consumption in communication network in the data center. However, the energy consumption in the communication network in a data center is not trivial, and therefore should be considered in the virtual machine placement in order to make the data center more energy-efficient. In this paper, we propose a genetic algorithm for a new virtual machine placement problem that considers the energy consumption in both the servers and the communication network in the data center. Experimental results show that the genetic algorithm performs well when tackling test problems of different kinds, and scales up well when the problem size increases.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has emerged as one of the most important technological revolutions globally. However, the rapid growth of cloud computing has imposed a massive financial burden and resulted in environmental side effects due to excessive energy consumption. The high power consumption is not only attributed to the size of data centers but also to the ineptitude of resource usage. Most of the extant research has focused on reducing power consumption by an aggressive VM consolidation, which leads to the violation of the service level agreement (SLA). Furthermore, the unbalanced resource consumption exacerbates the unavailable wasted resources that are referred to as unavailable resource fragmentation. In this paper, we propose the use of a balanced resources consumption algorithm called BRC-IBMMT in order to enhance the efficiency of resource consumption while achieving an acceptable balance between conflicting correlation objectives of power consumption as well as SLA violation. The extensive simulation results of different types of workload validate and lend credence to the significance of the proposed method in reducing power consumption and SLA violation of the cloud data center.},

The main goal of the paper is focused on the analysis of three important objectives (energy efficiency, robustness, and makespan) and the relationship among them.

On-site energy generation provides a greener and less expensive source of energy but its highly stochastic and intermittent nature makes production planning very complex. Demand Side Management (DSM) for real-time operation has emerged as an effective tool for carbon footprint reduction. In DSM, a local controller installed at the manufacturing facility uses an intelligent algorithm to make dynamic decisions for scheduling production line electrical loads. In this paper, we propose a framework for the intelligent algorithm in a job shop manufacturing facility aimed at minimizing the total electricity cost such that the total order delays are controlled. We consider a manufacturing facility with a wind mill as a source of on-site renewable electricity generation. The intelligent algorithm makes sequential decisions based on weighted objective function involving electricity cost and delay virtual queues while using different information e.g. historical decisions, current state and near future energy expectations from the wind mill. Job shop scheduling problems with traditional objective functions are NP Hard and the dimension of energy efficiency makes the problem more complicated. The intelligent algorithm developed in this paper uses Recurrent Neural Network for predicting electricity from the wind mill for the future time slots. Simulation results confirm that the proposed online algorithm framework for job shop scheduling is an effective DSM approach, outperforming the current industry practices and achieves results comparable to benchmark solutions.},

Among them, industrial energy consumption accounts for a large proportion due to the high power of manufacturing devices in the job-shop. To achieve higher energy-efficiency, lots of scheduling methods in the job-shop are developed. However, most of the current scheduling method is based on the prior-experimental data and the schedule of the production cycle cannot be adjusted according to energy status of manufacturing devices. Thus a dynamic scheduling system based on the cyber-physical energy monitoring system is proposed to improve the energy efficiency of the job-shop. First, a novel process of “scheduling-monitoring-updatingoptimizing”is implemented in the proposed system. In the scheduling model, tool aging condition is considered along with the geometry information of the work-piece to estimate energy consumption of the manufacturing process. At last, a modified genetic algorithm with multi-layer coding is applied to generate an energy-efficient schedule. The proposed system is implemented in a production cycle which contains 36 operations of six work-pieces and ten machine tools to prove its validity.},

	abstract = {Energy-aware production scheduling is a promising way to adapt the factories’ energy consumption behavior to the volatile electricity prices in the demand response initiative of smart grids. However, it may not be economical by simply scheduling production loads to the periods with lower electricity prices, as these periods often have higher labor wage, e.g., nights and weekends. Based on this gap, this paper proposes a many-objective integrated energy- and labor-aware flexible job shop scheduling model. Many objectives refer to the number of optimization objectives surpasses three (i.e., five objectives: makespan, total energy cost, total labor cost, maximal workload, and total workload), whereas the existing energy-aware production scheduling research is limited within three objectives. To enable energy awareness in the conventional production scheduling algorithms, a state-based shop floor wide energy model is proposed. To enable labor awareness, the number and type of human workers are matched to the scheduled production loads, with varying labor wage over shifts. As one of the most complex shop floor configurations, the partial flexible job shop further considers job recirculation and operation sequence-dependent machine setup times. The recently-proposed nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) is tailored for this many-objective optimization problem (MaOP), including scheduling solution encoding and decoding, crossover, mutation, and solution evaluation using the energy- and labor-aware discrete-event simulation framework. Through numerical experiments under real-time pricing (RTP) and time-of-use pricing (ToUP), insights are statistically obtained on the relation among these five production objectives; the effectiveness and efficiency of NSGA-III in solving a MaOP are also demonstrated. This proposed scheduling method can be used to automated and enhance the decision making of factory managers in jointly allocating machine, human worker, and energy resources on the shop floor, such that the production cost is minimized even under time-varying electricity and labor prices.},

	abstract = {Industry consumes approximately half of the total worldwide energy usage. With the increasingly rising energy costs in recent years, it is critically important to consider one of the most widely used energies, electricity, during the production planning process. We propose a new mathematical model that can determine efficient scheduling to minimize the makespan and electricity consumption cost (ECC) for the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP) under a time-of-use (TOU) policy. In addition to the traditional two subtasks in FJSSP, a new subtask called speed selection, which represents the selection of variable operating speeds, is added. Then, a modified biogeography-based optimization (MBBO) algorithm combined with variable neighborhood search (VNS) is proposed to solve the biobjective problem. Experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed MBBO algorithm for obtaining an improved scheduling solution compared to the basic biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA), and harmony search (HS).},

	abstract = {A bi-objective flexible cell scheduling problem (CSP) under time-of-use (TOU) electricity tariffs in both deterministic and fuzzy environments are developed with the following objectives: (1) total cost of production system and (2) total delivery tardiness of jobs. To create a form of green and energy-conscious strategy, cost of produced emission and consumed power and some limitations on entire energy consumption, total manufactured emission, setup time, part defect (pert) percentage, system productivity, total number of tool slots, operations, and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are respected. Besides, a self-adaptive two-phase subpopulation genetic algorithm (SATPSPGA) is taken to find a near-optimum solution of suggested bi-objective fuzzy mixed integer linear programming (FMILP) model. In view of the fact that no benchmark is existing in the literature, a self-adaptive non-dominated ranked genetic algorithm (SANRGA) and a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) were employed to solve the model. To validate the result, a GAMS model of problem is utilized and compared with algorithm outcomes as well. Lastly, several numerical examples are offered to show the utility of the proposed methodology.},

	abstract = {Flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is a typical discrete combinatorial optimization problem, which can be viewed as an extended version of the classical job shop scheduling problem. In previous researches, the scheduling problem has historically emphasized the production efficiency. Recently, scheduling problems with green criterion have been paid great attention by researchers. In this paper, the mathematical model of the low-carbon flexible job shop scheduling problem is established with the objective of minimizing the sum of the energy consumption cost and the earliness/tardiness cost. For solving the model, a kind of bi-population based discrete cat swarm optimization algorithm (BDCSO) is presented to obtain the optimal scheduling scheme in the workshop. In the framework of the BDCSO, two sub-populations are used to adjust the machine assignment and operation sequence respectively. At the initialization stage, a two-component discrete encoding mechanism is first employed to represent each individual, and then a heuristic method is adopted to generate the initial solutions with good quality and diversity. By considering the discrete characteristics of the scheduling problem, the modified updating methods are developed for the seeking and tracing modes to ensure the algorithm work directly in a discrete domain. To coordinate the global and local search in each sub-population, six adjustment curves are used to change the number of cats in the seeking and tracing modes, based on which six algorithms are developed, i.e., LBDCSO, SinBDCSO, CosBDCSO, TanBDCSO, LnBDCSO, and SquareBDCSO. In addition, the information exchanging strategy is introduced to implement the cooperation of the two sub-populations. Finally, extensive simulation based on random instances and benchmark instances is carried out. The comparisons results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in solving the FJSP under study.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, manufacturing industry is under increasing pressure to save energy and reduce emissions, and thereby enhancing the energy efficiency of the machining system (MS) through operational methods on the system-level has attracted more attention. Energy-efficient scheduling (ES) has proved to be a typical measure suitable for all shop types, and an energy-efficient mechanism that a machine can be switched off and back on if it waits for a new job for a relatively long period is another proven effective energy-saving measure. Furthermore, their combination has been fully investigated in a single machine, flow shop and job shop, and the improvement in energy efficiency is significant compared with only applying ES for MS. However, whether such two energy-saving measures can be integrated in a flexible job shop environment is a gap in the existing study. To address this, a scheduling method applying an energy-efficient mechanism is proposed for a flexible job shop environment and the corresponding mathematical model, namely the energy-efficient flexible job shop scheduling (EFJSS) model, considering total production energy consumption (EC) and makespan is formulated. Besides, transportation as well as its impact on EC is taken into account in this model for practical application. Furthermore, a solution approach based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is adopted, which can avoid the interference of subjective factors and help select a suitable machine for each operation and undertake rational operation sequencing simultaneously. Moreover, experimental results confirm the validity of the improved energy-efficient scheduling approach in a flexible job shop environment and the effectiveness of the solution.},

	abstract = {In the current business climate with increasingly changing customer requirements and strong business competition, manufacturing organisations need to enhance their productivity and adaptability in order to survive in the current business environment and raise their competitiveness. As a result, the optimisation of production scheduling in manufacturing systems has attracted increasing attention by manufacturers. The optimisation of manufacturing scheduling can be simplified as an optimisation problem for minimising processing cost and time with a set of constraints reflecting the technical relationships between jobs or job features and the resource capability and capacity. Conventional optimisation approaches including mathematical approaches, dispatching rules, heuristics and meta-heuristics have been applied in this research area but optimal solutions cannot be achieved in a reasonable computational time. In this PhD research, an agent based approach is developed for solving the manufacturing production optimisation problem. There is an agent iterative bidding mechanism coordinated by a Genetic Algorithm (GA) which facilitates the search for optimal routing and sequencing solutions for processing an entire job with shared manufacturing resources. A shop agent in the system works as a mediator which announces bidding operations, collects bids and decides winner machines according to a weight-based function. Machine agents with specific technical capability calculate the total production cost and lead time for job operations according to the predesigned operational sequence, and decide whether to submit their bids based on local utility. Another agent self-adjusting mechanism is employed for resource agents updating the priorities of unprocessed jobs in their buffers. The objective of each machine agent is to maximise local utility, i.e., to increase individual profit. After genetic generations for updating parameters with agent self-adjusting, the near optimal schedule plans can be found. 
On the other hand, the use of energy in all organisations has become a key issue worldwide. Carbon emissions from manufacturing processes of a company are under the pressure of government and also affect the public opinion. In the previous works from the literature, however, economic and environmental issues are not considered simultaneously in manufacturing production scheduling. Based on the basic agent based optimisation mechanisms, two extensive models with the consideration of the carbon emission during production are built in this research work, where the emission factor is set to be a constraint and another objective respectively. Numerical tests are utilised in order to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches. Furthermore, two previous approaches from the literature for solving the same problems are rebuilt and results are compared for testing the comparative performance of the proposed approaches. Test results show that near optimal schedule plans can be achieved in a reasonable computational time.},

	abstract = {The strengthening of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions meant that manufacturing scheduling had to acquire a green approach. The need to reduce energy consumption becomes necessary for companies to achieve sustainable development. Therefore, a new challenge for the scientific community was foreseen, researching new algorithms or knowledge hubs to achieve green scheduling. Green scheduling may be considered one of the principles of green manufacturing, aimed at minimizing environmental damage and energy waste. A review of the literature shows that there are no research works that analyze the scientific development carried out in “green scheduling” through methodologies based on bibliometric analysis, thus the need and the novelty of this research. Based on a dataset formed by 420 scientific documents published from 2006 to 2020 a bibliometric and network analysis is carried out to find the scientific trends, the main relationships according to collaborations and intermediaries, and the research hubs that help to establish the research agenda. The results show that “green scheduling” is a growing research area in the scientific community and in recent years the number of new research topics has experienced considerable growth. This research is developed in Asia, Europe and America, but China stands out as the most productive, collaborative, intermediary, influential and active country at present, through its organizations which are mainly universities, such as Huanzhong University of Science and Technology and Tongji University. However, research development related to green scheduling is carried out in a collaborative environment between institutions located in different countries, allowing countries that are not scientific powerhouses to develop research in the area. The network analysis makes it possible to define the research framework through the clustering of the dataset's research keywords, highlighting that the main areas of research focus on the development of new methods through algorithms aimed at improving energy efficiency in production environments, in areas of computational development such as cloud computing, and in transportation. The most cited research papers, considered the main drivers of knowledge, are published in high-quality research journals, and are mainly developments in scheduling algorithms for different work environments with a green approach. Research findings can provide the academic community with relevant information about green scheduling to make appropriate decisions and become a research agenda for future research.},

Consequently, computing accounts for an increasing amount of global energy usage, contradicting the objective of sustainable computing. The lack of hardware support and the absence of a standardized, software-centric method for the precise tracing of energy provenance exacerbates the issue. Aiming to overcome this challenge, we argue that fine-grained software energy attribution is attainable, even with limited hardware support. To support our position, we present a thread-level, NUMA-aware energy attribution method for CPU and DRAM in multi-tenant environments. The evaluation of our prototype implementation, EnergAt, demonstrates the validity, effectiveness, and robustness of our theoretical model, even in the presence of the noisy-neighbor effect. We envisage a sustainable cloud environment and emphasize the importance of collective efforts to improve software energy efficiency.},

Resources in data centers typically focus on providing high performance and availability, but the question of sustainability in managing these distributed resources often goes unnoticed over these other metrics. This problem will only exacerbate as the data center computing demand continues to increase. In this paper, we address the sustainability aspect of load balancing in VMware’s Avi Global Server Load Balancer (GSLB). Our GSLB deployment spans data centers across geographies and clouds and relies on geographical proximity to shift client application requests to the closest data center. In this work, we enhance the GSLB service to additionally consider the real-time carbon intensity at each data center as a factor in making a load-balancing choice. Our carbon-aware prototype shows an average of 21\% and a maximum of 51\% reduction in carbon emissions while operating with an acceptable latency.},

	abstract = {Climate change is a pressing threat to planetary well-being that can be addressed only by rapid near-term actions across all sectors. Yet, the cloud computing sector, with its increasingly large carbon footprint, has initiated only modest efforts to reduce emissions to date; its main approach today relies on cloud providers sourcing renewable energy from a limited global pool of options. We investigate how to accelerate cloud computing’s efforts. Our approach tackles carbon reduction from a software standpoint by gradually integrating carbon awareness into the cloud abstraction. Specifically, we identify key bottlenecks to software-driven cloud carbon reduction, including (1) the lack of visibility and disaggregated control between cloud providers and users over infrastructure and applications, (2) the immense overhead presently incurred by application developers to implement carbon-aware application optimizations, and (3) the increasing complexity of carbon-aware resource management due to renewable energy variability and growing hardware heterogeneity. To overcome these barriers, we propose an agile approach that federates the responsibility and tools to achieve carbon awareness across different cloud stakeholders. As a key first step, we advocate leveraging the role of application operators in managing large-scale cloud deployments and integrating carbon efficiency metrics into their cloud usage workflow. We discuss various techniques to help operators reduce carbon emissions, such as carbon budgets, service-level visibility into emissions, and configurable-yet-centralized resource management optimizations.},

While we are not (yet) able to turn on and off line cards in milliseconds, we can do so a couple of times per day. The question is, does it make sense to save energy? It may: We estimate we could potentially save in the order of MWh per year with link sleeping and down-rating in a cloud provider network. Importantly, these are “easy” gains: They would come without modifying the routing state nor impacting the quality of service of the traffic; it only leverages the typically low utilization of the links. This study provides only a rough approximation of the potential savings of rate adaptation and leaves several practical questions open. More than anything else, it motivates further investigation of the approach.},

	abstract = {Cloud platforms’ rapid growth is raising signiﬁcant concerns about their carbon emissions. To reduce emissions, future cloud platforms will need to increase their reliance on renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, which have zero emissions but are highly unreliable. Unfortunately, today’s energy systems effectively mask this unreliability in hardware, which prevents applications from optimizing their carbon-efﬁciency, or work done per kilogram of carbon emitted. To address this problem, we design an “ecovisor,” which virtualizes the energy system and exposes software-deﬁned control of it to applications. An ecovisor enables each application to handle clean energy’s unreliability in software based on its own speciﬁc requirements. We implement a small-scale ecovisor prototype that virtualizes a physical energy system to enable software-based application-level i) visibility into variable grid carbon-intensity and renewable generation and ii) control of server power usage and battery charging/discharging. We evaluate the ecovisor approach by showing how multiple applications can concurrently exercise their virtual energy system in different ways to better optimize carbon-efﬁciency based on their speciﬁc requirements compared to a general system-wide policy.},

	abstract = {Following the scarcity of resources, rising energy prices, and an increasing awareness of the role manufacturing plays in the generation of greenhouse gas emissions, the consumption of energy has more and more been the subject of research on production planning over the last decade. Even though recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of works published in this area, several related research questions have been opened up without sufficiently linking research approaches and research insights. The aim of this paper is to investigate the links between these questions and to highlight how the modeling approaches developed for different manufacturing systems, energy pricing policies, and energy efficiency criteria can benefit from each other and lead to more advanced energy-efficient production planning approaches. Therefore, this paper provides a review of the state-of-the-art of decision support models that integrate energy aspects into mid-term and short-term production planning of manufacturing companies. The paper first highlights the increasing importance of energy consumption in manufacturing and shows how considering energy consumption in production planning can contribute to more energy-efficient production processes. Subsequently, the paper outlines the review methodology used and descriptively analyzes the sampled papers. Afterwards, the selected papers are categorized according to the production planning tasks considered. From this classification, gaps in the existing literature are derived and potential areas for future research are suggested.},

This paper introduces Google's system for Carbon-Intelligent Compute Management, which actively minimizes electricity-based carbon footprint and power infrastructure costs by delaying temporally flexible workloads. The core component of the system is a suite of analytical pipelines used to gather the next day's carbon intensity forecasts, train day-ahead demand prediction models, and use risk-aware optimization to generate the next day's carbon-aware Virtual Capacity Curves (VCCs) for all datacenter clusters across Google's fleet. VCCs impose hourly limits on resources available to temporally flexible workloads while preserving overall daily capacity, enabling all such workloads to complete within a day. Data from operation shows that VCCs effectively limit hourly capacity when the grid's energy supply mix is carbon intensive and delay the execution of temporally flexible workloads to "greener" times.},

In this problem, a player attempts to find the \$k\$ lowest (alternatively, highest) prices in a sequence of fixed length \$T\$, which is revealed sequentially. At each time step, the player is presented with a price and decides whether to accept or reject it. The player incurs a switching cost whenever their decision changes in consecutive time steps, i.e., whenever they pause or resume purchasing. This online problem is motivated by the goal of carbon-aware load shifting, where a workload may be paused during periods of high carbon intensity and resumed during periods of low carbon intensity and incurs a cost when saving or restoring its state. It has strong connections to existing problems studied in the literature on online optimization, though it introduces unique technical challenges that prevent the direct application of existing algorithms. Extending prior work on threshold-based algorithms, we introduce double-threshold algorithms for both the minimization and maximization variants of this problem. We further show that the competitive ratios achieved by these algorithms are the best achievable by any deterministic online algorithm. Finally, we empirically validate our proposed algorithm through case studies on the application of carbon-aware load shifting using real carbon trace data and existing baseline algorithms.},

	abstract = {The demand for computing is continuing to grow exponentially. This growth will translate to exponential growth in computing's energy consumption unless improvements in its energy-efficiency can outpace increases in its demand. Yet, after decades of research, further improving energy-efficiency is becoming increasingly challenging, as it is already highly optimized. As a result, at some point, increases in computing demand are likely to outpace increases in its energy-efficiency, potentially by a wide margin. Such exponential growth, if left unchecked, will position computing as a substantial contributor to global carbon emissions. While prominent technology companies have recognized the problem and sought to reduce their carbon emissions, they understandably focus on their successes, which has the potential to inadvertently convey the false impression that this is now, or will soon be, a solved problem. Such false impressions can be counterproductive if they serve to discourage further research in this area, since, as we discuss, eliminating computing's, and more generally society's, carbon emissions is far from a solved problem. To better understand the problem's scope, this paper distills the fundamental trends that determine computing's carbon footprint and their implications for achieving sustainable computing.},

Exploiting this variability is an important factor in reducing the emissions caused by data centers. However, regional differences in the availability of low-carbon energy sources make it hard to provide general best practices for when to consume electricity. Moreover, existing research in this domain focuses mostly on carbon-aware workload migration across geo-distributed data centers, or addresses demand response purely from the perspective of power grid stability and costs. In this paper, we examine the potential impact of shifting computational workloads towards times where the energy supply is expected to be less carbon-intensive. To this end, we identify characteristics of delay-tolerant workloads and analyze the potential for temporal workload shifting in Germany, Great Britain, France, and California over the year 2020. Furthermore, we experimentally evaluate two workload shifting scenarios in a simulation to investigate the influence of time constraints, scheduling strategies, and the accuracy of carbon intensity forecasts. To accelerate research in the domain of carbon-aware computing and to support the evaluation of novel scheduling algorithms, our simulation framework and datasets are publicly available.},

Various Slurm parametric settings can significantly influence HPC resource utilization and job wait time, however in many cases it is hard to judge how these options will affect the overall HPC resource performance. The Slurm simulator can be a very helpful tool to aid parameter selection for a particular HPC resource. Here, we report our implementation of a Slurm simulator and the impact of parameter choice on HPC resource performance. The simulator is based on a real Slurm instance with modifications to allow simulation of historical jobs and to improve the simulation speed. The simulator speed heavily depends on job composition, HPC resource size and Slurm configuration. For an 8000 cores heterogeneous cluster, we achieve about 100 times acceleration, e.g. 20 days can be simulated in 5 h. Several parameters affecting job placement were studied. Disabling node sharing on our 8000 core cluster showed a 45\% increase in the time needed to complete the same workload. For a large system ({\textgreater}6000 nodes) comprised of two distinct sub-clusters, two separate Slurm controllers and adding node sharing can cut waiting times nearly in half.},

	abstract = {The world is facing major challenges related to global warming and emissions of greenhouse gases is a major causing factor. In 2017, energy industries accounted for 46\% of all CO2 emissions globally, which shows a large potential for reduction. This paper proposes a novel short-term CO2 emissions forecast to enable intelligent scheduling of flexible electricity consumption to minimize the resulting CO2 emissions. Two proposed time series decomposition methods are developed for short-term forecasting of the CO2 emissions of electricity. These are in turn bench-marked against a set of state-of-the-art models. The result is a new forecasting method with a 48-hour horizon targeted the day-ahead electricity market. Forecasting benchmarks for France show that the new method has a mean absolute percentage error that is 25\% lower than the best performing state-of-the-art model. Further, application of the forecast for scheduling flexible electricity consumption is studied for five European countries. Scheduling a flexible block of 4 h of electricity consumption in a 24 h interval can on average reduce the resulting CO2 emissions by 25\% in France, 17\% in Germany, 69\% in Norway, 20\% in Denmark, and just 3\% in Poland when compared to consuming at random intervals during the day.},

	abstract = {The cloud computing paradigm is an important service in the Internet for sharing and providing resources in a cost-efficient way. Modeling of a cloud system is not an easy task because of the complexity and large scale of such systems. Cloud reliability could be improved by modeling the various aspects of cloud systems, including scheduling, service time, wait time, and hardware and software failures. The aim of this study is to survey research studies done on the modeling of cloud computing using the queuing system in order to identify where more emphasis should be placed in both current and future research directions. This paper follows the goal by investigating the articles published between 2008 and January 2017 in journals and conferences. A systematic mapping study combined with a systematic literature review was performed to find the related literature, and 71 articles were selected as primary studies that were classified in relation to the focus, research type, and contribution type. We classified the modeling techniques of cloud computing using the queuing theory in seven categories based on their focus area: (1) performance, (2) quality of service, (3) workflow scheduling, (4) energy savings, (5) resource management, (6) priority-based servicing, and (7) reliability. A majority of the primary articles focus on performance (37\%), 15\% of them focus on resource management, 14\% of them focus on quality of service, 13\% of them focus on workflow scheduling, 13\% of them focus on energy savings, 4\% of them focus on priority-based servicing for requests, and 4\% of them focus on reliability. This work summarizes and classifies the research efforts conducted on applying queue theory for modeling of cloud computing (AQTMCC), providing a good starting point for further research in this area.},

GreenSlot predicts the amount of solar energy that will be available in the near future, and schedules the workload to maximize the green energy consumption while meeting the jobs’ deadlines. If grid energy must be used to avoid deadline violations, the scheduler selects times when it is cheap. Our results for production scientiﬁc workloads demonstrate that GreenSlot can increase green energy consumption by up to 117\% and decrease energy cost by up to 39\%, compared to a conventional scheduler. Based on these positive results, we conclude that green datacenters and green-energy-aware scheduling can have a signiﬁcant role in building a more sustainable IT ecosystem.},

In this context, the scheduling and resource management is usually performed by a grid resource broker. The scheduling task consists of distributing the jobs among the different centers resources and the need to coordinate the grid with the underlying scheduling levels which have already been identified. However, there is still a lack of policies for this approach. In this paper we describe and evaluate our coordinated grid scheduling strategy. We take as a reference the FCFS job scheduling policy and the matchmaking approach for the resource selection. We also present a new job scheduling policy based on backfilling (JR-backfilling) that aims to improve the workloads execution performance, avoiding starvation and the SLOW-coordinated resource selection policy that considers the average bounded slowdown of the resources as the main parameter to perform the resource selection. From our evaluation, based on trace-driven simulations of real grid systems, we state that our proposed coordinated strategy can substantially improve the workloads execution performance as well as the resource utilization.},

	abstract = {With the aim of enabling effective flexible electricity demand, a machine learning algorithm is developed to forecast the CO2 emission intensities in European electrical power grids distinguishing between average and marginal emissions. The analysis focuses on Danish bidding zone DK2 and was done on a data set comprised of a large number (473) of explanatory variables such as power production, demand, import, weather conditions etc., collected from selected neighboring zones. The number of variables was reduced to less than 30 using both LASSO (a penalized linear regression analysis) and a forward feature selection algorithm. Three linear regression models that capture different aspects of the data (non-linearities and coupling of variables etc.), were created and combined into a final model using Softmax weighted average. Cross-validation is performed for debiasing and an autoregressive moving average model (ARIMA) implemented to correct the residuals, making the final model an ARIMA with exogenous inputs (ARIMAX). Forecast errors vary between 0.095 and 0.183 (NRMSE) for the average emissions and 0.029–0.160 for the marginals depending on the forecast horizon (1–24 h). The forecasts with the corresponding uncertainties are analyzed and performance on very short (below six hours) and longer horizons are discussed –. One interesting result is that the marginal emissions were shown to be highly independent of any variables in the DK2 zone, suggesting that the marginal generators are located in the neighboring zones. The developed methodology can be applied to any bidding zone in the European electricity network without requiring detailed knowledge about the zone and with very few manual interactions.},

	abstract = {The global growth of cloud computing services is rising abruptly due to a large variety of services like computing, storage, network, etc. It expresses cloud service providers (CSPs) for better usage of existing datacenter resources, increasing agility, and reducing the need for unanticipated datacenter growth. These datacenters use a lot of energy generated from fossil fuels (i.e., non-renewable energy (NRE) sources) and omit a lot of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide, which cause the greenhouse effect and are harmful to the environment. Moreover, NRE sources are limited in supply and cannot be sustained over a long period. As a circumstance, CSPs are moving towards renewable energy (RE) sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, and biomass, to decarbonize datacenters even though these resources are not available round the clock. Therefore, recent studies focus on using both RE and NRE sources to avoid any interruption of the datacenter services. However, these studies consider the equal cost for all the RE sources and do not consider the categorization among user requests (URs). This paper considers the different costs for RE sources and two categories of URs, namely critical and non-critical, and introduces a cost-variant RE-based scheduling (CRES) algorithm for cloud computing. Here, the critical UR does not depend on the RE resources due to the unpredictability of RE sources. On the other hand, the non-critical UR can be accommodated by both RE and NRE resources. We simulate the proposed algorithm by considering 20 to 100 URs and 5 to 25 datacenters and compare the performance with the future-aware best fit (FABEF) and highest available renewable first (HAREF) algorithms in terms of cost and usage count of RE resources to show its usefulness.},

Today, to tackle this challenging issue, Cloud providers integrate renewable energy sources to feed their infrastructure. Energy saving is part often an integral many companies goal. Unlike the classic supply of grid energy, the production of green energy is unstable and depends on nature of the weather or wind. It introduces new challenges as pervasive jobs to reduce a server consumption. In this article, studies based on the use and the storage of photovoltaic energy are exposed. We detail our design of a scheduler which uses solar energy production to make an off-line decision. This enables us to schedule virtual machines into a datacenter via different algorithms which consumes the least amount of brown energy as possible. We based our analysis through an existing workload from Google. We describe and study this workload to create one corresponding to our need. We also proposed to evaluate the storage size of a smartgrid related to the solar panel size. It is an analysis of the reliance between both storage (battery) and renewable energy production (solar panel) components sizing.},

	abstract = {The rapid expansion of generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) is propelled by its perceived benefits, significant advancements in computing efficiency, corporate consolidation of artificial intelligence innovation and capability, and limited regulatory oversight. As with many large-scale technology-induced shifts, the current trajectory of Gen-AI, characterized by relentless demand, neglects consideration of negative effects alongside expected benefits. This incomplete cost calculation promotes unchecked growth and a risk of unjustified techno-optimism with potential environmental consequences, including expanding demand for computing power, larger carbon footprints, shifts in patterns of electricity demand, and an accelerated depletion of natural resources. This prompts an evaluation of our currently unsustainable approach toward Gen-AI’s development, underlining the importance of assessing technological advancement alongside the resulting social and environmental impacts. Presently, efforts to boost computing sustainability largely focus on efficiency improvements, including enhancing hardware energy efficiency, refining artificial intelligence algorithms, and improving the carbon efficiency of executing computing workloads through spatiotemporal workload shifting. In the presence of relentless demand and prioritization of economic growth, this siloed focus on efficiency improvements results instead in increased adoption without fundamentally considering the vast sustainability implications of Gen-AI. We argue that responsible development of Gen-AI requires a focus on sustainability beyond only efficiency improvements and necessitates benefit–cost evaluation frameworks that encourage (or require) Gen-AI to develop in ways that support social and environmental sustainability goals alongside economic opportunity. However, a comprehensive value consideration is complex and requires detailed analysis, coordination, innovation, and adoption across diverse stakeholders. Engaging stakeholders, including technical and sociotechnical experts, corporate entities, policymakers, and civil society, in a benefit–cost analysis would foster development in directions that are most urgent and impactful while also reducing unsustainable practices.},

	abstract = {Cloud platforms are increasing their emphasis on sustainability and reducing their operational carbon footprint. A common approach for reducing carbon emissions is to exploit the temporal flexibility inherent to many cloud workloads by executing them in periods with the greenest energy and suspending them at other times. Since such suspend-resume approaches can incur long delays in job completion times, we present a new approach that exploits the elasticity of batch workloads in the cloud to optimize their carbon emissions. Our approach is based on the notion of "carbon scaling," similar to cloud autoscaling, where a job dynamically varies its server allocation based on fluctuations in the carbon cost of the grid's energy. We develop a greedy algorithm for minimizing a job's carbon emissions via carbon scaling that is based on the well-known problem of marginal resource allocation. We implement a CarbonScaler prototype in Kubernetes using its autoscaling capabilities and an analytic tool to guide the carbon-efficient deployment of batch applications in the cloud. We then evaluate CarbonScaler using real-world machine learning training and MPI jobs on a commercial cloud platform and show that it can yield i) 51\% carbon savings over carbon-agnostic execution; ii) 37\% over a state-of-the-art suspend-resume policy; and iii) 8 over the best static scaling policy.},

In this problem, a player attempts to find the \$k\$ lowest (alternatively, highest) prices in a sequence of fixed length \$T\$, which is revealed sequentially. At each time step, the player is presented with a price and decides whether to accept or reject it. The player incurs a switching cost whenever their decision changes in consecutive time steps, i.e., whenever they pause or resume purchasing. This online problem is motivated by the goal of carbon-aware load shifting, where a workload may be paused during periods of high carbon intensity and resumed during periods of low carbon intensity and incurs a cost when saving or restoring its state. It has strong connections to existing problems studied in the literature on online optimization, though it introduces unique technical challenges that prevent the direct application of existing algorithms. Extending prior work on threshold-based algorithms, we introduce double-threshold algorithms for both the minimization and maximization variants of this problem. We further show that the competitive ratios achieved by these algorithms are the best achievable by any deterministic online algorithm. Finally, we empirically validate our proposed algorithm through case studies on the application of carbon-aware load shifting using real carbon trace data and existing baseline algorithms.},

Unfortunately, research on carbon-aware applications and the required interfaces between computing and energy systems remain complex, due to the scarcity of available testing environments. To this day, almost all new approaches are evaluated on custom simulation testbeds, which leads to repeated development efforts and low comparability of approaches. In this paper, we present our vision of a co-simulation testbed for carbon-aware applications and systems. We propose a versatile testbed which lets users connect domain-specific simulators for components like renewable power generation, energy storage, and power flow analysis with real software and hardware. By providing extensibility on the one hand and access to state-of-the-art implementations and datasets on the other, we hope to accelerate research in carbon-aware computing. In addition, a co-simulation testbed can be useful for development and operation, like in continuous testing. We implemented a working prototype of our idea and welcome the community to contribute to this vision.},

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning technique that enables distributed model training across data silos or edge devices without data sharing. Yet, FL inevitably introduces inefficiencies compared to centralized model training, which will further increase the already high energy usage and associated carbon emissions of machine learning in the future. One idea to reduce FL's carbon footprint is to schedule training jobs based on the availability of renewable excess energy that can occur at certain times and places in the grid. However, in the presence of such volatile and unreliable resources, existing FL schedulers cannot always ensure fast, efficient, and fair training.
 We propose FedZero, an FL system that operates exclusively on renewable excess energy and spare capacity of compute infrastructure to effectively reduce a training's operational carbon emissions to zero. Using energy and load forecasts, FedZero leverages the spatio-temporal availability of excess resources by selecting clients for fast convergence and fair participation. Our evaluation, based on real solar and load traces, shows that FedZero converges significantly faster than existing approaches under the mentioned constraints while consuming less energy. Furthermore, it is robust to forecasting errors and scalable to tens of thousands of clients.},

	abstract = {To achieve a sustainable energy system, a further increase in electricity generation from renewable energy sources (RES) is imperative. However, the development and implementation of RES entail various challenges, e.g., dealing with grid stability issues due to RES’ intermittency. Correspondingly, increasingly volatile and even negative electricity prices question the economic viability of RES-plants. To address these challenges, this paper analyzes how the integration of an RES-plant and a computationally intensive, energy-consuming data center (DC) can promote investments in RES-plants. An optimization model is developed that calculates the net present value (NPV) of an integrated energy system (IES) comprising an RES-plant and a DC, where the DC may directly consume electricity from the RES-plant. To gain applicable knowledge, this paper evaluates the developed model by means of two use-cases with real-world data, namely AWS computing instances for training Machine Learning algorithms and Bitcoin mining as relevant DC applications. The results illustrate that for both cases the NPV of the IES compared to a stand-alone RES-plant increases, which may lead to a promotion of RES-plants. The evaluation also finds that the IES may be able to provide significant energy flexibility that can be used to stabilize the electricity grid. Finally, the IES may also help to reduce the carbon-footprint of new energy-intensive DC applications by directly consuming electricity from RES-plants.},

Zero-carbon cloud proposes the use of these networks of datacenters as a geographically-distributed, supply-following load to utilize excess renewable generation (e.g. stranded power). Prior research has documented ample and growing stranded power, productive support of important computing workloads, the ability to increase grid renewable absorption, costcompetitiveness with traditional data centers, and the ability to reduce cloud computing’s carbon footprint. Recent developments suggest Zero-carbon cloud is at a breakout point, and datacenters as supply-following load being deployed. Datacenters as supply-following loads are intermittent but differ significantly for traditional unreliability models. These datacenters have high unavailability (1-20\%), large-scale (10,000 cpu’s), and predictable outage intervals. These properties raise a wealth of interesting research questions in cloud and energy systems in areas of resource management and scheduling (variable, stochastic capacity), how much cloud load is compatible with supply-following and can it be shaped, how to couple mutually distrustful power grid and cloud scheduling, how to clear power markets with stochastic bids, and how to manage power grids with stochastic bids.},

However, previous analyses suggest that corporate REC purchases are unlikely to lead to additional renewable energy production. Here we show that the widespread use of RECs by companies with science-based targets has led to an inflated estimate of the effectiveness of mitigation efforts. When removing the emission reductions claimed through RECs, companies’ combined 2015–2019 scope 2 emission trajectories are no longer aligned with the 1.5 °C goal, and only barely with the well below 2 °C goal of the Paris Agreement. If this trend continues, 42\% of committed scope 2 emission reductions will not result in real-world mitigation. Our findings suggest a need to revise accounting guidelines to require companies to report only real emission reductions as progress towards meeting their science-based targets.},

However, HPC schedulers do not incorporate workflow-specific mechanisms beyond the capacity to declare dependencies between their jobs. Thus, workflows are run as sets of batch jobs with dependencies, which induces long intermediate wait times and, consequently, long workflow turnaround times. Alternatively, to reduce their turnaround time, workflows may be submitted as single pilot jobs that are allocated their maximum required resources for their entire runtime. Pilot jobs achieve shorter turnaround times but reduce the HPC system's utilization because resources may idle during the workflow's execution. We present a workflow-aware scheduling (WoAS) system that enables existing scheduling algorithms to exploit fine-grained information on a workflow's resource requirements and structure without modification. The current implementation of WoAS is integrated into Slurm, a widely used HPC batch scheduler. We evaluate the system using a simulator using real and synthetic workflows and a synthetic baseline workload that captures job patterns observed over three years of workload data from Edison, a large supercomputer hosted at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center. Our results show that WoAS reduces workflow turnaround times and improves system utilization without significantly slowing down conventional jobs.},

	abstract = {Training Deep Learning (DL) model requires multiple resource types, including CPUs, GPUs, storage IO, and network IO. Advancements in DL have produced a wide spectrum of models that have diverse usage patterns on different resource types. Existing DL schedulers focus on only GPU allocation, while missing the opportunity of packing jobs along multiple resource types. We present Muri, a multi-resource cluster scheduler for DL workloads. Muri exploits multi-resource interleaving of DL training jobs to achieve high resource utilization and reduce job completion time (JCT). DL jobs have a unique staged, iterative computation pattern. In contrast to multi-resource schedulers for big data workloads that pack jobs in the space dimension, Muri leverages this unique pattern to interleave jobs on the same set of resources in the time dimension. Muri adapts Blossom algorithm to find the perfect grouping plan for single-GPU jobs with two resource types, and generalizes the algorithm to handle multi-GPU jobs with more than two types. We build a prototype of Muri and integrate it with PyTorch. Experiments on a cluster with 64 GPUs demonstrate that Muri improves the average JCT by up to 3.6× and the makespan by up to 1.6× over existing DL schedulers.},

	abstract = {To reduce their environmental impact, cloud datacenters' are increasingly focused on optimizing applications' carbon-efficiency, or work done per mass of carbon emitted. To facilitate such optimizations, we present Carbon Containers, a simple system-level facility, which extends prior work on power containers, that automatically regulates applications' carbon emissions in response to variations in both their work-load's intensity and their energy's carbon-intensity. Specifically, Carbon Containers enable applications to specify a maximum carbon emissions rate (in g.CO2e/hr), and then transparently enforce this rate via a combination of vertical scaling, container migration, and suspend/resume while maximizing either energy-efficiency or performance. Carbon Containers are especially useful for applications that i) must continue running even during high-carbon periods, and ii) execute in regions with few variations in carbon-intensity. These low-variability regions also tend to have high average carbon-intensity, which increases the importance of regulating carbon emissions. We implement a Carbon Container prototype by extending Linux Containers to incorporate the mechanisms above and evaluate it using real workload traces and carbon-intensity data from multiple regions. We compare Carbon Containers with prior work that regulates carbon emissions by suspending/resuming applications during high/low carbon periods. We show that Carbon Containers are more carbon-efficient and improve performance while maintaining similar carbon emissions.},

	abstract = {Cloud research to date has lacked data on the characteristics of the production virtual machine (VM) workloads of large cloud providers. A thorough understanding of these characteristics can inform the providers' resource management systems, e.g. VM scheduler, power manager, server health manager. In this paper, we first introduce an extensive characterization of Microsoft Azure's VM workload, including distributions of the VMs' lifetime, deployment size, and resource consumption. We then show that certain VM behaviors are fairly consistent over multiple lifetimes, i.e. history is an accurate predictor of future behavior. Based on this observation, we next introduce Resource Central (RC), a system that collects VM telemetry, learns these behaviors offline, and provides predictions online to various resource managers via a general client-side library. As an example of RC's online use, we modify Azure's VM scheduler to leverage predictions in oversubscribing servers (with oversubscribable VM types), while retaining high VM performance. Using real VM traces, we then show that the prediction-informed schedules increase utilization and prevent physical resource exhaustion. We conclude that providers can exploit their workloads' characteristics and machine learning to improve resource management substantially.},

	abstract = {The continued exponential growth of cloud datacenter capacity has increased awareness of the carbon emissions when executing large compute-intensive workloads. To reduce carbon emissions, cloud users often temporally shift their batch workloads to periods with low carbon intensity. While such time shifting can increase job completion times due to their delayed execution, the cost savings from cloud purchase options, such as reserved instances, also decrease when users operate in a carbon-aware manner. This happens because carbon-aware adjustments change the demand pattern by periodically leaving resources idle, which creates a trade-off between carbon emissions and cost. In this paper, we present GAIA, a carbon-aware scheduler that enables users to address the three-way trade-off between carbon, performance, and cost in cloud-based batch schedulers. Our results quantify the carbon-performance-cost trade-off in cloud platforms and show that compared to existing carbon-aware scheduling policies, our proposed policies can double the amount of carbon savings per percentage increase in cost, while decreasing the performance overhead by 26\%.},

	abstract = {The ever-increasing demand for energy is resulting in considerable carbon emissions from the electricity grid. In recent years, there has been growing attention on demand-side optimizations to reduce carbon emissions from electricity usage. A vital component of these optimizations is short-term forecasting of the carbon intensity of the grid-supplied electricity. Many recent forecasting techniques focus on day-ahead forecasts, but obtaining such forecasts for longer periods, such as multiple days, while useful, has not gotten much attention. In this paper, we present CarbonCast, a machine-learning-based hierarchical approach that provides multi-day forecasts of the grid's carbon intensity. CarbonCast uses neural networks to first generate production forecasts for all the electricity-generating sources. It then uses a hybrid CNN-LSTM approach to combine these first-tier forecasts with historical carbon intensity data and weather forecasts to generate a carbon intensity forecast for up to four days. Our results show that such a hierarchical design improves the robustness of the predictions against the uncertainty associated with a longer multi-day forecasting period. We also analyze which factors most influence the carbon intensity forecasts of any region with a specific mixture of electricity-generating sources. We show that CarbonCast's 4-day forecasts have a MAPE of 4.80--13.93\% across six geographically distributed regions while outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, CarbonCast is the first open-sourced tool for multi-day carbon intensity forecasts where the code and data are freely available to the research community.},

Unlike performance analyses, however, power and energy measurements of heterogeneous systems are difficult to conduct.

Yet, such measurements are essential to improve software components for low power and high energy-efficiency.In this paper, we analyze and discuss the power and energy characteristics of several heterogeneous systems with up to 20 cores (160 hardware threads) and 1 TB of main memory. For the analyzed systems, we outline challenges regarding power and energy measurements and show ways to overcome limitations (i.e., sampling constraints). To improve the current state of the art in power and energy measurements at the system-software level, we present the design and implementation of PINPOINT, an energy-profiling tool which unifies different power and energy measurement interfaces.},

Recent work has shown that a system’s power draw can support reliable conclusions about running workloads, which serves as a basis for runtime placement decisions to adapt the system’s cumulative energy demand to the available energy supply in a volatile electricity grid.In this work, we reproduce earlier findings on the classification of running workload from a set of previously known workloads purely through external power measurements. Using a k-nearest neighbors classifier, we identify workloads of the NAS benchmark suite with a macro F1-score of 98\% for OpenMP-based implementations and 85\% for MPI-based implementations.},
